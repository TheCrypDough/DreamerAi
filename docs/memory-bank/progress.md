# Progress

## Current Status
- Ready for Day 2 tasks.

## What Works
- Day 1 Initial Setup completed via manual script execution.
- Core directory structure created (C:\DreamerAI).
- Git repository initialized, configured, linked to GitHub (TheCrypDough/DreamerAi), initial commit pushed.
- Configuration files created (`data/config/.env.development`, `data/config/config.dev.toml`) with OpenRouter (Llama 3 70B) / Ollama (gemma3:12b) settings.
- `.gitignore` created.
- `data/models` symlink confirmed present (pre-existing).

## What's Left to Build
- Day 2: Environment Setup (Python venv, dependencies via `requirements.txt`).
- All subsequent development tasks outlined in `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.

## Known Issues
- Initial Day 1 batch script execution via Cursor tool failed (Error logged, resolved via manual execution).
- Cursor AI requires strict adherence reminders regarding rule execution (Ongoing).
