# Progress Summary
*Last Updated: [AUTO_TIMESTAMP]*

- **What works:** 
    - Day 1-26 foundations established.
    - Build system fixed (Electron Forge structure at root, `electron-rebuild` configured).
    - Application builds and launches correctly (`npm start`).
    - Keytar native module loads successfully in the main process.
    - Secure IPC placeholder channel (`start-github-auth`) is functional for triggering main process logic from the renderer.
    - V1 HTTP Bridge (Frontend listener in `App.jsx`, Backend POST via `engine.core.bridge`) is restored and allows basic chat functionality.
    - Backend server starts correctly using `python -m engine.core.server` or `uvicorn engine.core.server:app`.
    - WebSocket connection from frontend to backend Dream Theatre endpoint works when backend is running.

- **What's left to build/implement:**
    - Functional GitHub OAuth flow (Day 26.1 - Current focus).
    - Saving/using the GitHub token securely.
    - All subsequent features/agents from Day 27 onwards.

- **Current Status:**
    - Completed Day 26 (Foundation Refactor).
    - Ready to begin Day 26.1 (Functional GitHub Auth Flow V2).

- **Known Issues & Blockers:**
    - Backend server requires specific startup command (`python -m` or `uvicorn`) due to relative imports in `engine/core/server.py`.
    - GitHub credentials (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`) are not yet configured in `data/config/.env.development` for the main process environment.
    - Redis connection fails (Tracked Issue).
    - OpenRouter intermittent TypeError (Tracked Issue).
    - DB Pool functions missing in `engine/core/db.py` (Mitigated with try/except).
    - Dream Theatre messages missed if the panel/tab is inactive (Known Limitation).
    - Electron DevTools console shows CSP warning for 'unsafe-eval' (Common in dev).
