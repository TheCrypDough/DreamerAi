# DreamerAI Progress (Memory Bank)
Last Updated: 2025-04-18 02:20:00 (After Day 18 Completion & Correction)

## What Works:
*   **Core Agent Structures (Placeholders):**
    *   Jeff V1 (Main Chat) - Basic conversation loop functional.
    *   Arch V1 (Planning) - Placeholder, can generate basic blueprint file.
    *   Nexus V1 (Coding Manager) - Placeholder, logs simulation steps.
    *   Lewis V1 (Administrator) - Placeholder, loads toolchest.json.
    *   Hermie V1 (Communications) - Placeholder structure verified (Day 18 Test).
*   **Core Systems:**
    *   BaseAgent V2: Stabilized version providing RAG (ChromaDB/SentenceTransformer), memory persistence, state management, rules loading.
    *   LLM Module: Handles OpenRouter & Ollama providers (config-driven).
    *   Logging System: Centralized logging via Loguru operational.
    *   DreamerFlow V2: Basic sequential orchestration (Jeff->Arch->Nexus V1) demonstrated.
    *   UI Bridge: Backend can push updates to frontend listener (port 3131).
*   **Frontend Shell:**
    *   Electron app launches.
    *   Basic React UI with MUI tabs and chat panel (partially integrated).
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Python venv functional (Python 3.12).
    *   Node.js environment functional in `/app`.
    *   Git repository connected to GitHub.

## What's Left (High Level):
*   Full implementation of all 28 agent functionalities beyond placeholders.
*   Advanced DreamerFlow orchestration (complex sequences, error handling, dynamic routing via Hermie).
*   Complete UI integration (connecting all panels, state management).
*   n8n workflow integration (task handoff).
*   Robust error handling and recovery across all systems.
*   Comprehensive automated testing framework (unit, integration).
*   Packaging and distribution (`electron-builder`).
*   Refinement of configuration and secret management.
*   PostgreSQL integration for scalable data persistence.
*   Redis integration for caching (currently disabled).

## Current Status:
*   **Completed Day:** Day 18 (Hermie V1 Placeholder Test - Corrected Scope & Execution).
*   **Current Day:** Ready to start Day 19 (Hermie V1 Basic Routing Simulation).
*   **Overall Feeling:** Back on track after significant Day 18 corrections. Adherence to guide and BaseAgent V2 strategy is critical.

## Known Issues & Blockers:
*   **Jeff V2 n8n Handoff:** Requires code implementation for verification. (Logged Issue #20250418014500 - Status: Open).
*   **Redis Connection:** Fails consistently (Error 10061). LLM caching disabled. (Logged Errors - Status: Known Issue, Requires Redis server setup - Day 38 target).
*   **DB Pool Functions:** `initialize_db_pool`, `close_db_pool` are missing from `engine.core.db`. Handled via `try/except` in Day 18 `main.py` test, but requires proper implementation (likely with PostgreSQL setup - Day 100 target).
*   **OpenRouter API:** Intermittent `TypeError: AIOR_Handler.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'loop'` observed in logs (Needs monitoring/investigation if persists).
