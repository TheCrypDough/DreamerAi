# Progress

*Last Updated: 2025-04-18 HH:MM:SS*

## Current Status
- Day 17 (Lewis & Foundational Placeholders) completed.
- V1 placeholders for Lewis (Admin), Arch (Planning), and Nexus (Coding Mgr) are implemented, inheriting from BaseAgent V2.
- Rules files (`rules_lewis.md`, `rules_arch.md`, `rules_nexus.md`) created/updated.
- `tools/toolchest.json` created and populated for Lewis.
- `main.py` successfully tested the V1 placeholder functionalities.
- Project is ready for Day 18: Hermie V1 & UI Bridge V2.

## What Works
- BaseAgent V2 (RAG, Memory, Rules, State, Logging).
- ChefJeff V1 (Basic interaction, RAG query).
- Arch V1 (Placeholder blueprint generation).
- Nexus V1 (Placeholder dummy file creation).
- Lewis V1 (Toolchest JSON cache loading and querying).
- DreamerFlow V2 simulation (Jeff -> Arch -> Nexus V1) completes.
- Basic Electron frontend shell (Day 10) launches.
- Basic React UI with Tabs (Day 10) renders.
- UI Bridge V1 (Agent -> Frontend via POST) works but needs refinement.
- Basic chat UI panel (Day 14) exists.
- Logging to files (`daily_context`, `rules_check`, `migration_tracker`, `issues`, `errors`).

## What's Left to Build (High Level)
- Hermie V1 (Communications Hub).
- UI Bridge V2 (Dedicated endpoints).
- Functional chat integration (Jeff <-> UI).
- Remaining 23 core agents (implementing V1 placeholders first).
- Functional code generation (Nexus V2+ coordinating specialists).
- Dreamer Desktop UI refinement (Panels, Layout, Theming).
- SnapApp template integration (Lewis V2+).
- Core services (DB interactions beyond RAG, Authentication, etc.).
- Plugin system.
- Testing framework expansion.
- Build/Deployment pipeline.

## Known Issues
- UI Bridge V1 is basic, lacks specific endpoints and error handling.
- Frontend doesn't actively send messages *to* the backend yet (Day 14 UI is display-only).
- Redis connection errors logged in `main.py` test (expected as Redis isn't running/configured).
- n8n webhook connection errors logged (expected).
- Some `Get-Content` errors at end of `main.py` run (likely PS/Cat issue, non-blocking for Python code).
