## Current Work Focus

Starting Day 27: VC Remote Ops Backend.

## Recent Changes

- Completed Day 26.1 functional GitHub Auth flow.
- Verified and rebuilt the `keytar` native module using `electron-rebuild`.
- Implemented the secure OAuth 2.0 flow entirely within the Electron main process (`main.js`):
    - Triggered via IPC (`start-github-auth`) from the renderer (`GitHubSignIn.jsx`).
    - Launched the GitHub authorization URL in the default browser using `shell.openExternal`.
    - Started a temporary local HTTP server (`http://localhost:9876`) to listen for the OAuth callback.
    - Extracted the authorization `code` from the callback URL.
    - Exchanged the `code` for an access token by making a secure HTTPS POST request to `https://api.github.com/app/installations/.../access_tokens`, including the client ID and client secret (loaded securely from environment variables).
    - Securely stored the obtained access token in the OS keychain using `keytar.setPassword`.
    - Cleared the temporary server.
    - Sent the obtained token to the backend API (`/auth/github/token`) via `fetch` (or `httpx`).
    - Implemented logic to retrieve (`keytar.getPassword`) and delete (`keytar.deletePassword`) the token for status checking and unlinking.
- Refined UI feedback in `GitHubSignIn.jsx` to reflect success/failure/linking status based on IPC results and keychain checks.
- Successfully tested the end-to-end flow: linking via UI button, browser authorization, callback handling, token storage, backend notification, UI update, and unlinking.
- Resolved backend connection errors (`ECONNREFUSED`) during testing by correcting the `BACKEND_URL` in `main.js` from `http://localhost:8000` to `http://localhost:8090`.
- Reverted real GitHub secrets from the environment/code after successful testing.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with Day 27 tasks sequentially as outlined in the `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.
- Focus on implementing the backend logic for remote Git operations (push, pull, clone) using the stored GitHub token.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Confirmed the Day 26.1 main-process OAuth flow is functional and adheres to security best practices (secrets not exposed to renderer, token stored securely).
- The temporary HTTP server approach for the OAuth callback is effective for development.
- The backend endpoint `/auth/github/token` successfully receives the token but currently stores it in a non-persistent global variable; this needs a proper database storage solution later.
- Need to ensure the backend uses the received GitHub token correctly for authenticated remote Git operations in Day 27.
