- **Current work focus:** Starting Day 26.1, Task 1: Verify electron-rebuild setup.
- **Recent changes:** Completed Day 26 foundation refactor. Ran `npx electron-forge import`, moving build configs to root. Installed `electron-rebuild` and verified `keytar` loads in main process. Modified `main.js` (keytar load attempt, IPC placeholder), `preload.js` (whitelist), `GitHubSignIn.jsx` (trigger button), `App.jsx` (restored V1 HTTP listener). Uninstalled `electron-oauth2`. Resolved merge conflicts after `git pull`. Tested build, load, keytar, IPC trigger, and HTTP bridge successfully. Corrected backend server startup using `python -m engine.core.server` or `uvicorn`.
- **Next steps:** Proceed with Day 26.1 tasks sequentially: Implement functional main process GitHub OAuth flow using temp HTTP server and keytar.
- **Active decisions:** Verified Day 26 refactoring successful. Confirmed file structure changes from `electron-forge import` are correct and supersede older guide instructions regarding config file locations. Confirmed backend server requires specific startup command (`python -m` or `uvicorn`).
- **Key Challenges/Blockers:** None currently. Need to ensure GitHub App callback URL and secrets are correctly handled during Day 26.1 testing.
