## Current Work Focus
*   **Completed:** Day 26 Tasks (Implicitly) - Full GitHub OAuth UI Flow Implementation & Debugging.
*   **Goal:** Log completion and prepare for next guided task.

## Recent Changes (GitHub Auth UI Debugging Marathon)
*   **Completed:** Successfully implemented and debugged the entire GitHub OAuth flow via Electron IPC.
*   **Key Steps & Fixes:**
    *   Refactored `GitHubSignIn.jsx` to use IPC (`github-oauth-flow`) instead of direct `electron-oauth2`.
    *   Added `github-oauth-flow` handler in `main.js`.
    *   Corrected `exports is not defined` error by converting all relevant frontend components (`App.jsx`, `MainChatPanel.jsx`, `DreamTheatrePanel.jsx`, `ProjectManagerPanel.jsx`, `SettingsPanel.jsx`) to use ES Module `import`/`export` syntax.
    *   Resolved `require is not defined` by removing direct `require('http')` usage from `App.jsx` (incompatible with `nodeIntegration:false`).
    *   Fixed "IPC bridge unavailable" by setting `contextIsolation: true` / `nodeIntegration: false` in `main.js` and correctly exposing `electronAPI` via `contextBridge` in `preload.js`.
    *   Fixed `OAuth is not a constructor` error by correcting the `require('electron-oauth2')` statement in `main.js`.
    *   Fixed GitHub 404 error after sign-in by replacing placeholder Client ID/Secret with actual credentials (redirect URI was confirmed correct).
    *   Fixed `No handler registered for 'secure-keytar-get'` by adding `keytar` import and IPC handlers (`get`, `save`, `delete`) in `main.js`.
    *   Fixed Webpack `node-loader` build error by adding `keytar` to `externals` in `webpack.main.config.js`.
*   **Outcome:** The "Link GitHub Account" button in the Settings tab now successfully initiates the OAuth flow, allows user sign-in, and updates the UI to "GitHub Account Linked".

## Next Steps
*   Complete the logging updates for this debugging session.
*   Identify the next official task from the `DreamerAi_Guide.md` (likely related to saving the received token or proceeding with Day 27).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Deviation:** Acknowledged significant deviation from the guide was necessary to achieve functional GitHub authentication. Future tasks should attempt stricter adherence where possible.
*   **Credentials:** Actual GitHub Client ID/Secret are currently hardcoded with `// REMOVE LATER` comments. Secure handling needs to be implemented (tracked via TODO D66/D107).
*   **Keytar:** IPC handlers for `keytar` are now in place in `main.js`. The `secure-keytar-save` handler needs to be called after successful OAuth to persist the token.
*   **UI State:** The `SettingsPanel` UI correctly reflects the linked state. Further steps might involve fetching user info or displaying errors more granularly.
