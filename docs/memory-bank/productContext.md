# DreamerAI Product Context (V1 - Placeholder)

**Problem Solved:** Modern app development is complex, slow, and has a steep learning curve. Existing AI tools lack integration, depth, or user focus.
**How it Works:** A desktop app using a team of specialized AI agents (The Dream Team) to automate and guide the build process, from idea refinement (Promptimizer, Jeff) to planning (Arch), coding (Nexus/Nerds), QA (Herc/Bastion), and packaging (Nike). Integrates education (Spark).
**User Experience:** Aims to be user-friendly, nurturing, engaging ("fun, addictive, supportive"), customizable (Dreamer Desktop), and educational for all skill levels.
