Daily Context Log - 

## Achievements:
Milestone Completed: Day 1 Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration. Next Task: Day 2 Environment Setup & Core Dependencies. Feeling: Foundation poured, blueprints look solid! Ready for tools. Date: 2024-05-24

Milestone Completed: Day 2 Environment Setup & Core Dependencies (Revised). Next Task: Day 3 BaseAgent & Logging System. Feeling: Finally resolved Day 2 dependency conflicts (DnD, ESLint). Ready to move forward definitively. Date: 2025-04-10

Milestone Completed: Day 3 BaseAgent & Logging System. Next Task: Day 4 Electron Frontend Skeleton. Feeling: Day 3 properly completed, tested, and approved. Rules adherence reinforced. Foundation feels solid. Date: 2025-04-10

## Issues:
- Day 1: Manual symlink creation required due to permissions. Git commands needed step-by-step execution initially.
- Day 2 (Revised): Significant npm peer dependency conflicts requiring `--legacy-peer-deps`. Incompatibility of `eslint-config-airbnb` with ESLint v9.
- Day 3: Initial Pydantic validation error on `BaseAgent` resolved by declaring field. Minor PowerShell errors during testing related to `| cat` piping, but Python scripts executed successfully.

## Next Steps:
- Day 1: Proceeded to Day 2.
- Day 2: Proceeded to Day 3.
- Day 3: Proceeding to Day 4.

## Rules Updates:
- Day 1: None.
- Day 2: None.
- Day 3: None.

## Testing Notes:
- Day 1: Verified structure, config files, symlink (manual), and GitHub commit.
- Day 2: Verified venv, requirements.txt, app/node_modules, package.json/lock, eslint.config.mjs. Confirmed n8n exclusion. Manual Git commit needed due to earlier failed installs.
- Day 3: Verified base.py and logger.py content via read_file. Successfully executed `python -m engine.core.logger` and `python -m engine.agents.base` test blocks.

## Suggestions & Resolutions:

Suggestion (Day 2): Replace `react-beautiful-dnd` with `dnd-kit` due to React 19 incompatibility. Task: Day 2 Environment Setup & Core Dependencies, Rationale: `react-beautiful-dnd` requires React <=18, causing conflicts. `dnd-kit` is a modern, compatible alternative, aligning with the 'cutting-edge' principle better than forcing incompatible dependencies. Feeling: Confident this is the best path forward., Date: 2024-05-24
*   **Resolution (Day 2 - Revised):** Implemented. `@dnd-kit/core` was installed instead of `react-beautiful-dnd`.

Suggestion (Day 2): Remove `n8n` from `app/package.json` devDependencies. Task: Day 2 Environment Setup & Core Dependencies, Rationale: Installing `n8n` directly into the frontend project is highly unconventional, significantly bloats `node_modules`, and introduces numerous unrelated warnings/vulnerabilities. n8n should be managed as a separate service/application. Feeling: Strongly recommended., Date: 2024-05-24
*   **Resolution (Day 2 - Revised):** Implemented. `n8n` was not included in the `npm install` commands.
