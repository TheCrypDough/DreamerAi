# DreamerAI Context Memory Aid

## Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration
*   **Summary**: Established base project structure in C:\DreamerAI. Initialized Git repository and linked to GitHub remote (TheCrypDough/DreamerAi). Created structured configuration files (`data/config/.env.development` for secrets, `data/config/config.dev.toml` for settings). Established symbolic link `data/models` -> `C:\Users\thecr\.ollama\models` (manually by user). Created `.gitignore` file. Pushed initial structure and configuration to GitHub.
*   **Key Decisions**: Adopted TOML for structured configuration alongside `.env` for secrets, preparing for flexible LLM loading (Day 6). Followed directory structure defined in rules.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: Initial setup approved after verifying GitHub push. Ready to proceed.
*   **Blocking Issues**: Encountered issues running multi-step script commands due to terminal modification/interruption. Switched to step-by-step execution. Required manual creation of symbolic link due to lack of Administrator privileges in terminal session.
