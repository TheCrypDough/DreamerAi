## Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration (OpenRouter/Ollama Ready!)

*   **Task Name:** Day 1 Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration
*   **Summary of Work:** Created base project structure in C:\DreamerAI. Initialized Git repository and linked to TheCrypDough/DreamerAi. Created `.gitignore`. Created `data/config/.env.development` (with placeholder `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and `data/config/config.dev.toml` specifying OpenRouter (meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct) as cloud_tier1 and Ollama (gemma3:12b) as local fallback. `mklink` command in script failed due to no Admin rights, but pre-existing symlink confirmed by user. Initial commit pushed to GitHub.
*   **Key Decisions Made:** Use OpenRouter/Ollama combo from Day 1. Separate secrets (.env) from config (.toml).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion after manual script execution. Emphasized need for strict rule adherence.
*   **Blocking Issues Encountered/Resolved:** Batch script failed to execute via tool. Resolved by user running script manually. `migration_tracker.md` logging initially missed, corrected before approval.

## Day 2: Environment Setup (LightRAG/ChromaDB Update) - Completed: 2025-04-15

*   **Summary**: Established Python virtual environment (`venv`). Manually installed Python dependencies (consolidated list including LightRAG, ChromaDB, ST, Torch - excluding `ragstack`) due to initial tool execution failures (required Python 3.11 downgrade). Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`npm init -y`). Installed required Node.js dependencies (including `@dnd-kit/core`, excluding `n8n`, `react-beautiful-dnd`). Installed Node dev dependencies (`eslint`, `electron-builder`). Ran interactive ESLint initialization (`npx eslint --init`), navigating updated prompts and creating `eslint.config.mjs`. Updated `.gitignore` with Node-specific entries.
*   **Key Decisions**: Proceeded with manual Python dependency installation after tool failures. Adapted to updated ESLint interactive prompts.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: Approved Day 2 completion. Noted initial script/pip execution failures and mirroring issues as known problems.
*   **Blocking Issues Resolved**: Python dependency installation failures resolved via manual install and Python downgrade. ESLint prompt changes handled during interactive setup.

**Task Completed: Day 3 - BaseAgent & Logging System**
*   **Timestamp:** 2025-04-15 02:25:00 # Placeholder Timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Implemented BaseAgent abstract class in `engine/agents/base.py` using Pydantic (incl. Memory, Message models) and abc. Used `Field(init=False)` for `agent_chat_dir` set in `model_post_init` after debugging Pydantic V2 initialization. Set up centralized Loguru logging in `engine/core/logger.py` (`DreamerLogger`) with console, dev file, error file, and `rules_check.log` sinks (using filters/specific formats). Added test blocks (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to both modules.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Used `Field(init=False)` and `model_post_init` for `agent_chat_dir` to resolve Pydantic/linter conflicts. Refined `.gitignore` and used `git add -f` to track `rules_check.log` after `git add` failures.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** `python -m engine.agents.base` and `python -m engine.core.logger` test blocks executed successfully. Git changes staged, committed, pushed via tool.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Pydantic V2/linter issues with `agent_chat_dir` initialization resolved. `git add` issue with ignored log file resolved via `-f`. `git commit/push` initially failed but succeeded on retry.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion after Git issues resolved.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4 (Placeholder - Fetch tasks from Guide).

**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 1: Create main.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:21:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Created the file C:\DreamerAI\app\main.js containing the main process code for the Electron application shell. This includes importing `app` and `BrowserWindow` from Electron, defining a `createWindow` function to set up the window dimensions and webPreferences (enabling Node integration and DevTools), loading `index.html`, and handling basic application lifecycle events (`whenReady`, `activate`, `window-all-closed`).
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Used standard Electron boilerplate code as provided in the Day 4 guide. Kept `nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false` for initial development simplicity as per guide instructions, noting they need review later.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** File successfully created. Verification will occur when `npm start` is run later in Day 4.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Create the file C:\DreamerAI\app\index.html with the provided HTML structure.

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 2: Create index.html**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:26:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Created the file C:\DreamerAI\app\index.html. This is the basic HTML structure loaded by Electron, containing the #root div for React, basic dark theme styling, and inclusion of the renderer.js script. Added viewport meta tag to address linter warning.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Followed guide specification. Addressed linter warning by adding viewport meta tag.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** File successfully created. Linter warning resolved. Verification will occur when `npm start` is run later in Day 4.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Linter warning (missing viewport) resolved.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion and linter fix.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Create the file C:\DreamerAI\app\renderer.js with the provided initial React rendering code.

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 3: Create renderer.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:30:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Created the file C:\DreamerAI\app\renderer.js. This file uses React and ReactDOM (via require) to define a basic functional component `App` that renders an `<h1>Hello from DreamerAI!</h1>` tag. It utilizes the React 18 `createRoot` API to mount this component into the `div#root` element within `index.html`.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Followed guide specification, using the modern `createRoot` API as instructed.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** File successfully created. Verification will occur when `npm start` is run later in Day 4.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Create an empty file C:\DreamerAI\app\preload.js.

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 4: Create preload.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:34:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Created the file C:\DreamerAI\app\preload.js. Although the task specified an empty file, the guide provided sample content, which was included: comments explaining the preload script's role and a `DOMContentLoaded` listener logging 'Preload script executed' to the console.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Followed the guide's code example over the literal task description ("empty file") to include the standard console log for verification.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** File successfully created. Verification will occur when `npm start` is run later in Day 4.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Modify C:\DreamerAI\app\package.json. Add a "main": "main.js" key-value pair (if not already present from npm init). Add a start script under "scripts": "start": "electron .".

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 5: Modify package.json**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:38:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Modified C:\DreamerAI\app\package.json. Confirmed that the "main" entry point was already set to "main.js" and the "start" script to "electron .". Added the "lint": "eslint ." script to the "scripts" section as per the guide's code example.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Added the lint script based on the guide's example, even though it wasn't explicitly in the task description, for completeness.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** File successfully modified. JSON is valid.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Run npm start from the C:\DreamerAI\app\ directory to launch the Electron application and verify the "Hello from DreamerAI!" message appears in the window. Close the app after verification.

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 6: Run npm start**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:45:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Executed `npm start` within the `C:\DreamerAI\app` directory using the terminal tool.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** N/A
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** Electron application window launched successfully. DevTools confirmed `preload.js` execution. Expected CSP security warning noted. Assumed "Hello from DreamerAI!" text was visible based on successful launch and renderer setup.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None (Security warning is expected).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved task completion based on console logs and implied visual confirmation.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 4, Task: Stage changes (main.js, index.html, renderer.js, preload.js, package.json), commit, and push to GitHub.

---
**Task Completed: Day 4 - Task 7: Git Commit & Push**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-26 16:55:00 # Approximate timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Staged and committed the changes made to `app/main.js`, `app/index.html`, `app/renderer.js`, `app/preload.js`, and `app/package.json` with the message "Day 4: Set up Electron frontend skeleton with basic React rendering". Pushed the commit to origin main. Subsequently, staged and committed the documentation updates (`tasks.md`, `dreamerai_context.md`, `daily_context_log.md`, `rules_check.log`) with the message "Docs: Update logs and context for Day 4 completion" and pushed again after user identified they were missed.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Committed documentation separately after user pointed out it was missed in the initial task-specific commit.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** Git commands completed successfully. Commits `528aaf6` and `e0d9b21` pushed to GitHub.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Initial commit missed documentation files; resolved with a second commit.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion of Day 4.
*   **Next Task Context:** Day 4 Complete. Pausing development for the day. Next: Day 5.

**Day 5: SQLite Database & Basic UI Bridge**
*   **Summary:** Implemented initial SQLite DB setup in `engine/core/db.py` (tables: `projects`, `chats`) noting PostgreSQL planned for scale. Created basic FastAPI/Uvicorn server (`engine/core/server.py`) on port 8000 with CORS enabled. Modified `app/renderer.js` to add a `useEffect` hook to fetch from the backend root `/` endpoint on mount.
*   **Key Decisions:** Start with SQLite for dev speed, plan PostgreSQL migration. Establish backend/frontend bridge early.
*   **Testing:** Verified backend connection success via console log. Initial DB creation failed on server start, required manual `python -m engine.core.db` run to create `dreamer.db`.
*   **Issues:** Guide specified modifying `server.py`, but file didn't exist (created instead). Linter errors in `db.py` logger import (resolved). `run_terminal_cmd` interrupted server start, likely cause of initial DB creation failure.
*   **Vibe:** Progress! Basic persistence and communication established.
*   **Next Task:** Day 6 - Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup.

---
**Task:** Day 6 - Task 4: Execute `llm.py` test block
**Summary:** Completed implementation and testing of the core LLM module (`engine/ai/llm.py`). Successfully debugged and resolved issues related to config loading (nested structure, `tomllib`), API key environment variable loading (`load_dotenv`, `override=True`), and `asyncio` misuse. Verified successful connections and generation using both the configured OpenRouter provider (`cloud_tier1`) via API key and the local Ollama provider (`ollama`). Redis caching remains integrated but disabled pending Redis server setup (Day 38).
**Key Decisions:** Added `override=True` to `load_dotenv`. Made `_check_ollama_status` synchronous to avoid nested `asyncio.run()` calls.
**Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion, guided debugging process.
**Blocking Issues:** Initial test failures due to config parsing, API key loading, and `asyncio` errors (all resolved).

---
**Task Completed: Day 7 - Agent Framework Overview & Week 1 Check**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-27 19:30:00 # Placeholder
*   **Summary of Work:** Introduced the 28-agent "Dream Team" architectural concept. Created placeholder Python files (`main_chat.py`, `planning.py`, `coding_manager.py`, `administrator.py`, `communications.py`, `promptimizer.py`, `__init__.py`) in `engine/agents/`. Created and executed a temporary check script (`tests/week1_check.py`) which successfully verified `DreamerDB` instantiation/connection and `LLM` instantiation/generation (using OpenRouter). Deleted the temporary check script. Corrected earlier deviation from Day 7 plan.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Followed the revised Day 7 plan focusing on framework setup before agent implementation. Deferred distillation and full Test environment deployment.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** `week1_check.py` executed successfully, confirming DB and LLM basic functionality. Placeholder files created. Approved by Anthony.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Corrected internal state after previous deviation from Day 7 guide.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Corrected course after deviation.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 8, Task: [Placeholder for Day 8 Task 1].

---
**Task Completed: Day 8 - Build Chef Jeff V1 (ChromaDB RAG)**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-27 19:50:00 # Placeholder
*   **Summary of Work:** Implemented initial `ChefJeff` agent (`engine/agents/main_chat.py`) inheriting from existing `BaseAgent`. Created `rules_jeff.md`. Seeded ChromaDB collection `rag_jeff_db` via temporary script. Added test block to `main_chat.py`. Debugged initialization (`sys` import, Pydantic `PrivateAttr` for `_llm`, explicit `_llm` init) and execution.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Added test block to `main_chat.py` instead of modifying non-existent `main.py`. Commented out dependencies on future features (`event_manager`, `send_update_to_ui`). Made `ChefJeff` explicitly initialize its own LLM instance due to `BaseAgent` V1 limitations.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** Test block execution verified core conversation loop, LLM generation, and task keyword identification. Known limitations logged: RAG query failed (`query_rag` missing in `BaseAgent`), n8n connection failed (expected), event/bridge calls disabled.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Logged `query_rag` issue (#Issue). Logged n8n/Redis connection errors (#Error). Logged disabled features issue (#Issue). Resolved initialization errors through debugging.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion, directed debugging steps.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 9, Task: Create `engine/core/workflow.py`.

---
**Task Completed: Day 9 - DreamerFlow Orchestration Setup**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-27 20:10:00 # Placeholder
*   **Summary of Work:** Created `engine/core/workflow.py` and implemented the initial `DreamerFlow` class. Created `main.py` in the root directory. Added test logic to `main.py` to instantiate `ChefJeff` and `DreamerFlow`, then executed the flow with `asyncio.run`, verifying the orchestrator successfully called Jeff's `run` method.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Established the core workflow orchestrator (`DreamerFlow`) early. Used `main.py` for initial end-to-end testing before building a full server/UI integration.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** `python main.py` executed successfully. Logs confirmed `DreamerFlow` initialized, called `ChefJeff`, and received an LLM response. Known limitations (RAG/n8n) persisted as expected. Approved by Anthony.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** None specific to Day 9 tasks. n8n connection error logged during test run (expected).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 10, Task: Refactor `main.py` for continuous input/dynamic agent map.

---
**Task Completed: Day 10 - UI Shell (Tabs, Beginner Mode, Listener) & Build Process Setup**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-27 21:20:00 # Placeholder
*   **Summary of Work:** Created `app/src/App.jsx` with basic MUI tabs, switch, and HTTP listener. Refactored `renderer.js` to load it. **Deviation:** Encountered `Cannot find module` error due to unhandled JSX. Implemented `electron-forge` build process with Webpack/Babel, including installing dependencies (`@electron-forge/cli`, `@electron-forge/plugin-webpack`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-react`, `babel-loader`, `@vercel/webpack-asset-relocator-loader`), creating config files (`forge.config.js`, `webpack.*.js`), updating `package.json` (`main` entry, scripts), and `main.js` (Forge variables). Resolved subsequent errors (missing loader, `http` external, asset relocator version, `main` entry point, CSP for fonts, removed hardcoded script tag in `index.html`). Verified UI functionality via `npm start`.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Authorized deviation to implement necessary build process instead of using non-standard workarounds for JSX. Corrected `main` entry in `package.json` based on Forge docs. Added `devContentSecurityPolicy` to allow Google Fonts.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** `npm start` successfully launched the app. UI elements (tabs, switch) visible and functional. DevTools console showed listener started and no critical errors (expected CSP warning remains).
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Initial Task 4 verification failed due to missing JSX transpilation. Subsequent errors related to Webpack/Forge config (`http` module, asset relocator, `main` entry, CSP, script tag) were resolved.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Authorized deviation, requested thorough logging.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 11, Task: (Placeholder - Get from Guide).

---
**Task Completed: Day 11 Task 1 - PlanningAgent Class Structure**
*   **Summary:** Implemented the basic class structure for `PlanningAgent` (Arch) in `engine/agents/planning.py`. Replaced placeholder code with imports, class definition inheriting `BaseAgent`, `__init__` (instantiating `LLM`), `_get_output_path` helper (using `pathlib` to create `Overview` subdirectory), and method signatures/placeholders for `run` and `step`. The `run` method's implementation is pending the next task.
*   **Key Decisions Made:** Followed guide structure precisely. Used `pathlib` for robust path handling in `_get_output_path`.
*   **Testing:** Verified linter passed after fixing syntax errors in dummy exception classes and a unicode escape error in a docstring example path.
*   **Blocking Issues Encountered/Resolved:** Linter errors (dummy class syntax, unicode escape) identified and resolved.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Frustrated by previous looping but approved task completion.
*   **Next Task:** Day 11 Task 2 - Implement run method in PlanningAgent.

---
**Task Completed: Day 11 - Planning Agent V1 (Arch)**
*   **Timestamp:** 2024-07-12 17:05:00 # Approximate
*   **Summary of Work:** Completed implementation of PlanningAgent (Arch) V1 (`engine/agents/planning.py`). Implemented `run` method to construct LLM prompt, call `_llm.generate`, and save output to `[project_path]/Overview/blueprint.md` using `pathlib`. Modified `main.py` to instantiate Arch and test the flow (Jeff -> Arch direct call). Fixed `ValueError` in `BaseAgent` by adding `_llm = PrivateAttr` and updating Arch to use `self._llm`. Successfully executed `main.py`, verified Arch ran, and generated `blueprint.md` (manual content check needed by user).
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Used `PrivateAttr` for `_llm` in `BaseAgent` to fix Pydantic issue. Called Arch directly from `main.py` as `DreamerFlow` doesn't yet handle multi-agent sequences.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** `python main.py` test executed successfully. Logs confirmed Jeff and Arch execution. `blueprint.md` creation confirmed via log messages. Git commit/push successful.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Resolved `ValueError: "PlanningAgent" object has no field "llm"`. Noted expected Redis/n8n/RAG failures during test.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Okay.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 12 (Fetch tasks from Guide).
