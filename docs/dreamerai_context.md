# DreamerAI Context Memory Aid

## Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration
*   **Summary**: Established base project structure in C:\DreamerAI. Initialized Git repository and linked to GitHub remote (TheCrypDough/DreamerAi). Created structured configuration files (`data/config/.env.development` for secrets, `data/config/config.dev.toml` for settings). Established symbolic link `data/models` -> `C:\Users\thecr\.ollama\models` (manually by user). Created `.gitignore` file. Pushed initial structure and configuration to GitHub.
*   **Key Decisions**: Adopted TOML for structured configuration alongside `.env` for secrets, preparing for flexible LLM loading (Day 6). Followed directory structure defined in rules.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: Initial setup approved after verifying GitHub push. Ready to proceed.
*   **Blocking Issues**: Encountered issues running multi-step script commands due to terminal modification/interruption. Switched to step-by-step execution. Required manual creation of symbolic link due to lack of Administrator privileges in terminal session.

## Day 2: Environment Setup & Core Dependencies (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Established Python virtual environment (`venv/`) and installed core Python dependencies (`requirements.txt`) including FastAPI, Uvicorn, Ollama, RAGstack, Transformers, PyYAML, python-dotenv, etc. Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`package.json`), installed core runtime dependencies (React, Electron, MUI, etc.) and development dependencies (`eslint`). Configured ESLint using the flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`) with Airbnb rules (via individual plugins due to v9 compatibility issues). Updated `.gitignore`.
*   **Key Decisions:** Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to install ESLint Airbnb plugins due to version conflict with ESLint v9. Adopted ESLint flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`).
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Emphasized not "half-assing" the ESLint setup, requiring adherence to Airbnb standards. Noted terminal output issues.
*   **Blocking Issues:** Significant issues with `npm install` for ESLint plugins due to peer dependency conflicts (ESLint v9 vs Airbnb config) and unreliable terminal execution/output. Resolved by manually confirming installation via `package.json` and using `--legacy-peer-deps`. Initial Git commits were incomplete due to failed installations; corrected with a final comprehensive commit.

## Day 2 (Revised): Environment Setup & Core Dependencies (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Established Python virtual environment (`venv/`) and installed core Python dependencies (`requirements.txt`). Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`package.json`), installed core runtime dependencies (React, Electron, MUI, `@dnd-kit/core` instead of `react-beautiful-dnd`). Installed ESLint v9 and compatible plugins (`eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-import`). Configured ESLint using the flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`) with recommended settings (instead of incompatible `eslint-config-airbnb`). Updated `.gitignore`.
*   **Key Decisions:** Replaced incompatible `react-beautiful-dnd` with `@dnd-kit/core`. Abandoned `eslint-config-airbnb` due to ESLint v9 incompatibility, opting for recommended ESLint/React/JSX-A11y rulesets within flat config. Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to force installations past dependency conflicts.
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Directed revert to Day 2 to properly handle dependency conflicts with React 19 / ESLint 9. Emphasized using compatible, modern libraries (`dnd-kit`) and configurations.
*   **Blocking Issues:** Initial ESLint setup using `npx eslint --init` did not prompt for style guides. Direct installation of `eslint-config-airbnb` failed due to peer dependency conflict with ESLint v9. Installations of other packages were also blocked by ESLint conflicts until `--legacy-peer-deps` flag was used. Resolved by removing `eslint-config-airbnb` and configuring ESLint using recommended rulesets compatible with v9.

## Day 3: BaseAgent & Logging System (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Created `engine/agents/base.py` defining the `BaseAgent` abstract class using Pydantic (including `Message`, `Memory`, `AgentState`) and `abc`. Added `user_dir` parameter to `__init__`. Implemented basic `run` loop with `step` abstraction and basic error handling. Created `engine/core/logger.py` with `DreamerLogger` class using Loguru, configuring console, development file, error file, and rules_check file sinks. Added `log_rules_check` helper. Added test blocks to both files.
*   **Key Decisions:** Used Loguru for flexible logging. Made `BaseAgent` require `user_dir` on init. Used Pydantic for agent structure.
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Approved completion after verification of test block execution. Emphasized the importance of following the rules strictly, especially testing and approval before moving on.
*   **Blocking Issues:** None during final execution. Initial test of `BaseAgent` failed with Pydantic `ValueError` because `agent_chat_dir` was set before being declared. Resolved by declaring `agent_chat_dir` as a model field.

## Day 4: Electron Frontend Skeleton (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Created `app/main.js` (Electron main process), `app/index.html` (entry point), `app/renderer.js` (initial React rendering), and `app/preload.js`. Updated `app/package.json` with `main` entry and `start`/`lint` scripts. Tested successfully using `npm start`, verifying window launch and "Hello from DreamerAI!" message.
*   **Key Decisions:** Used standard Electron setup. Set `nodeIntegration: true`, `contextIsolation: false` for simplicity in early dev (flagged for later security review). Used React 18 `createRoot` API.
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Confirmed successful launch via screenshot.
*   **Blocking Issues:** None.

## Day 5: SQLite Database & Basic UI Bridge (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Implemented `engine/core/db.py` with `DreamerDB` class for SQLite interaction (creating `data/db/dreamer.db` with `projects` and `chats` tables). Modified `engine/core/server.py` to instantiate `DreamerDB` on startup/shutdown and added `CORSMiddleware`. Modified `app/renderer.js` to fetch from the backend root endpoint on mount.
*   **Key Decisions:** Used SQLite for initial local dev (PostgreSQL planned for scale). Added `CORSMiddleware` to FastAPI. Instantiated DB on server startup.
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Confirmed successful backend connection message in frontend. Noted initial failure to create DB file and Electron security warning.
*   **Blocking Issues:** Initial run failed to create `dreamer.db` because `DreamerDB` wasn't instantiated in `server.py` (resolved). Initial backend start via `python -m` failed due to module loading error (resolved by using `uvicorn` directly). CORS blocked initial frontend fetch (resolved by adding middleware).

## Day 6: Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup

*   **Summary:** Implemented `LLMManager` class (`engine/ai/llm.py`) to manage multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible/OpenRouter) based on `config.dev.toml`. Added logic for loading configs, API keys (from `.env.development` via `api_key_env`), initializing clients, checking provider status, and performing generation with priority/fallback. Configured Ollama (`gemma3:12b`) and OpenRouter (`openrouter/optimus-alpha`). Tested via `python -m engine.ai.llm`.
*   **Decisions:** Using OpenRouter as the primary cloud provider. Using `gemma3:12b` as the Ollama fallback. Manually fixed `_check_ollama_status` to use root URL (`/`) due to external execution issue.
*   **Feedback:** Approved after resolving Ollama status check issue via manual fix.
*   **Issues:** Initial `.env` parsing errors. OpenRouter 400 errors due to incorrect model name/config syntax. Persistent Ollama status check failure (404 on `/api/generate`) due to external environment/tooling issue, bypassed with manual code fix to check root `/` instead.

## Day 7: Nexus Agent - The Orchestrator

*   **Task Name**: Day 7: Nexus Agent - The Orchestrator
*   **Summary of Work**: Created the initial Nexus agent class (`engine/ai/nexus.py`) inheriting from `BaseAgent`. Implemented basic initialization using the `LLM` class (from Day 6, corrected from `LLMManager`). Added a test block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to verify initialization and basic LLM interaction via the `LLM.generate` method.
*   **Key Decisions Made**: 
    *   Corrected `LLMManager` references to `LLM` to match the class definition in `engine/ai/llm.py`.
    *   Corrected logger initialization in `nexus.py` to use the patched global instance instead of direct instantiation.
    *   Corrected Pydantic field definition and initialization order in `Nexus.__init__`.
    *   Corrected usage of `AgentState` (using `RUNNING` instead of non-existent `PROCESSING`).
    *   Corrected arguments passed to `LLM.generate` (using `messages` list and individual parameters).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: N/A (Assumed approval based on 'yes' to proceed).
*   **Blocking Issues Encountered/Resolved**: 
    *   Resolved `TypeError` on `DreamerLogger` init.
    *   Resolved `ValueError` on Pydantic initialization (missing `llm` field).
    *   Resolved `ValidationError` on Pydantic initialization (incorrect `super().__init__` call order).
    *   Resolved `AttributeError` on invalid `AgentState.PROCESSING`.
    *   Resolved `TypeError` on `LLM.generate` call arguments.

## Day 8: Building Chef Jeff (Main Chat Agent)

*   **Task 8.1: Create/Refine rules_jeff.md:** Completed. Created `engine/agents/rules_jeff.md` using the standard template (`docs/templates/rules_template.md`) and incorporated detailed context from `docs/Agent_Details.md`. This provides a comprehensive definition of Jeff's role, scope, memory, and operating principles as the primary user interaction conduit. Updated `tasks.md` with all Day 8 tasks. Resolved issue where `tasks.md` wasn't updated prior to commit.
*   **Task 8.2: Seed Jeff RAG DB:** Completed. Created temporary script `scripts/seed_rag_jeff.py` and successfully seeded a persistent ChromaDB collection at `data/rag_dbs/rag_jeff` using `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model). This followed troubleshooting of initial `ragstack` import errors and resolving a `client.persist()` `AttributeError` in ChromaDB. Dependencies (`chromadb`, `sentence-transformers`) were implicitly installed/confirmed.
*   **Task 8.3: Implement ChefJeff Class:** Completed. Modified `engine/agents/main_chat.py` to include the `ChefJeff` class inheriting from `BaseAgent`. Implemented core logic including loading rules (`_load_rules`), initializing ChromaDB/sentence-transformer (`_initialize_rag`), retrieving RAG context (`_retrieve_rag_context`), preparing messages for LLM, calling the configured LLM (`self.llm.generate` with `agent_name='Jeff'`), adding messages to memory, and calling placeholder functions (`route_tasks_n8n`, `send_update_to_ui`). Refactored field definitions using `pydantic.Field`.
*   **Task 8.4: Test ChefJeff Class:** Completed. Successfully executed the test block in `main_chat.py` after extensive debugging. Resolved issues related to `BaseAgent` field validation (`user_dir`), Pydantic field definition order (`rules`, `llm`, etc.), `BaseAgent` signature mismatches (`step`, `run`), incorrect `Memory` method usage (`get_formatted_history`, `get_history(last_n=...)`), incorrect `Message` instantiation (`sender` vs `role`), and incorrect `LLM.generate` usage (passing formatted string vs message list). Test verified RAG initialization, rule loading, LLM call via OpenRouter, and memory updates.
*   **Task 8.5: Delete seed_rag_jeff.py:** Completed. Deleted the temporary RAG seeding script `scripts/seed_rag_jeff.py` as it is no longer needed.

## Day 9: DreamerFlow Orchestration Setup
*   **Summary:** Implemented the `DreamerFlow` class structure in `engine/core/workflow.py`, initialized with an agent dictionary (currently just Jeff). The basic `execute` method delegates input directly to Jeff. Created `main.py` as a backend entry point to instantiate Jeff and `DreamerFlow` and run a test execution, verifying the initial orchestration pass-through.
*   **Key Decisions:** Deferred complex multi-agent workflow logic within `DreamerFlow` to later days, keeping the initial setup focused on structure. Used `main.py` for backend testing separate from the eventual FastAPI server context.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** (Assumed approval) Back on track!
*   **Blocking Issues:** Initial `main.py` test runs failed due to `TypeError` in `ChefJeff`'s `super().__init__` call (passing `user_dir` twice) and a `TypeError` in `DreamerFlow.execute` (passing `initial_user_input` instead of `initial_input` to `jeff_agent.run`). Both were resolved by correcting the respective function calls.

## Completed Task Summaries

**Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration**
* Summary: Created base C:\DreamerAI structure, initialized Git repo (TheCrypDough/DreamerAi), set up config files (`.env.development`, `config.dev.toml`), defined `.gitignore`, and created symlink `C:\DreamerAI\data\models` -> `C:\Users\thecr\.ollama\models` (manual step required).
* Decisions: Using TOML for primary config, dotenv for secrets. Initial providers: Ollama (local), OpenRouter (cloud). DB: SQLite (dev).
* Feedback: Proceed.
* Issues: Symlink required manual admin privilege.

**Day 2: Environment Setup & Core Dependencies**
* Summary: Created Python venv. Installed Python dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Loguru, Ollama, requests, dotenv, etc.) via pip and generated `requirements.txt`. Initialized npm in `app/`, installed Node dependencies (Electron, React, MUI, @dnd-kit/core, etc.), installed ESLint dev dependency, initialized ESLint config. Updated `.gitignore`.
* Decisions: Used `@dnd-kit/core` instead of `react-beautiful-dnd` due to React 19 incompatibility. Explicitly excluded `n8n` from frontend dependencies.
* Feedback: Proceed after resolving initial dependency/linting issues.
* Issues: Significant npm peer dependency conflicts resolved with `--legacy-peer-deps`. ESLint v9 incompatibility with AirBnB config required separate initialization.

**Day 3: BaseAgent & Logging System**
* Summary: Created `engine/agents/base.py` defining `BaseAgent` abstract class with state, memory, async run/step methods. Created `engine/core/logger.py` implementing `DreamerLogger` using Loguru for file-based logging (dev/error logs).

* Decisions: Standard Electron setup.
* Feedback: Approved.
* Issues: None.

**Day 5: SQLite Database & Basic UI Bridge**
* Summary: Created `engine/core/db.py` with `DreamerDB` class for SQLite connection (`C:\DreamerAI\data\db\dreamer.db`) and initial `projects` table creation. Modified `engine/core/server.py` to run FastAPI/Uvicorn. Added root endpoint and tested connection from `renderer.js` using `fetch`.
* Decisions: Using SQLite for initial dev persistence. FastAPI for backend API.
* Feedback: Approved.
* Issues: Initial module load error in `server.py` fixed. CORS blocked initial fetch, fixed by adding middleware. DB not created initially, fixed by ensuring instantiation.

**Day 6: Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup**
* Summary: Implemented `LLMManager` class (`engine/ai/llm.py`) to manage multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible/OpenRouter) based on `config.dev.toml`. Added logic for loading configs, API keys (from `.env.development` via `api_key_env`), initializing clients, checking provider status, and performing generation with priority/fallback. Configured Ollama (`gemma3:12b`) and OpenRouter (`openrouter/optimus-alpha`). Tested via `python -m engine.ai.llm`.
* Decisions: Using OpenRouter as the primary cloud provider. Using `gemma3:12b` as the Ollama fallback. Manually fixed `_check_ollama_status` to use root URL (`/`) due to external execution issue.
* Feedback: Approved after resolving Ollama status check issue via manual fix.
* Issues: Initial `.env` parsing errors. OpenRouter 400 errors due to incorrect model name/config syntax. Persistent Ollama status check failure (404 on `/api/generate`) due to external environment/tooling issue, bypassed with manual code fix to check root `/` instead.

**Day 7: Nexus Agent - The Orchestrator**
* Summary: Created the initial Nexus agent class (`engine/ai/nexus.py`) inheriting from `BaseAgent`. Implemented basic initialization using the `LLM` class (from Day 6, corrected from `LLMManager`).

* Feedback: Approved.
* Issues: Resolved `TypeError` on `DreamerLogger` init. Resolved `ValueError` on Pydantic initialization (missing `llm` field). Resolved `ValidationError` on Pydantic initialization (incorrect `super().__init__` call order). Resolved `AttributeError` on invalid `AgentState.PROCESSING`. Resolved `TypeError` on `LLM.generate` call arguments.

**Day 8: Building Chef Jeff (Main Chat Agent)**
*   **Task 8.1: Create/Refine rules_jeff.md:** Completed. Created `engine/agents/rules_jeff.md` using the standard template (`docs/templates/rules_template.md`) and incorporated detailed context from `docs/Agent_Details.md`.
