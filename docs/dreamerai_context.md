**Task Completed: Day [XX] - [Task Name from tasks.md]**
*   **Timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
*   **Summary of Work:** [Detailed summary of *what* was technically implemented or changed by this specific task. Mention key files modified/created, core logic added/refactored, concepts addressed. Be specific - e.g., "Refactored BaseAgent._initialize_rag_db to use chromadb.PersistentClient and SentenceTransformer. Added query_rag helper using collection.query."]
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** [Note any significant choices made during implementation or clarifications received from Anthony, e.g., "Used direct ChromaDB API in BaseAgent helper V1 for simplicity instead of LightRAG Retriever abstraction.", "Decided to keep Client Secret placeholder in renderer V1.1 due to library limitation, added stronger TODO."]
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** [Result reported by Cursor and approved by Anthony. E.g., "Tests Passed: Memory persistence verified via main.py. BaseAgent RAG query successful in Jeff V1 log check. Approved by Anthony.", "Manual Test Passed: UI displays TreeView, subproject creation successful via selection. Approved.", "Scan Completed: No High/Critical vulns found. Approved."]
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** [Reference any issues logged/resolved specifically during *this* task. E.g., "Logged Issue #15 (Minor parsing error in logs).", "Resolved Issue #12 (Corrected path in config).", "None."]
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** [Optional: Capture key feedback or observed sentiment from Anthony during task review/approval, e.g., "Anthony emphasized need for robust error handling.", "Feeling positive about progress."]
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day [YY], Task: [Next Task Name from tasks.md].

## Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration (OpenRouter/Ollama Ready!)

*   **Task Name:** Day 1 Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration
*   **Summary of Work:** Created base project structure in C:\DreamerAI. Initialized Git repository and linked to TheCrypDough/DreamerAi. Created `.gitignore`. Created `data/config/.env.development` (with placeholder `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and `data/config/config.dev.toml` specifying OpenRouter (meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct) as cloud_tier1 and Ollama (gemma3:12b) as local fallback. `mklink` command in script failed due to no Admin rights, but pre-existing symlink confirmed by user. Initial commit pushed to GitHub.
*   **Key Decisions Made:** Use OpenRouter/Ollama combo from Day 1. Separate secrets (.env) from config (.toml).
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved completion after manual script execution. Emphasized need for strict rule adherence.
*   **Blocking Issues Encountered/Resolved:** Batch script failed to execute via tool. Resolved by user running script manually. `migration_tracker.md` logging initially missed, corrected before approval.

## Day 2: Environment Setup (LightRAG/ChromaDB Update) - Completed: 2025-04-15

*   **Summary**: Established Python virtual environment (`venv`). Manually installed Python dependencies (consolidated list including LightRAG, ChromaDB, ST, Torch - excluding `ragstack`) due to initial tool execution failures (required Python 3.11 downgrade). Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`npm init -y`). Installed required Node.js dependencies (including `@dnd-kit/core`, excluding `n8n`, `react-beautiful-dnd`). Installed Node dev dependencies (`eslint`, `electron-builder`). Ran interactive ESLint initialization (`npx eslint --init`), navigating updated prompts and creating `eslint.config.mjs`. Updated `.gitignore` with Node-specific entries.
*   **Key Decisions**: Proceeded with manual Python dependency installation after tool failures. Adapted to updated ESLint interactive prompts.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: Approved Day 2 completion. Noted initial script/pip execution failures and mirroring issues as known problems.
*   **Blocking Issues Resolved**: Python dependency installation failures resolved via manual install and Python downgrade. ESLint prompt changes handled during interactive setup.

**Task Completed: Day 2 - Environment Setup (LightRAG/ChromaDB Update)**
*   **Timestamp:** 2025-04-15 01:25:00 # Placeholder Timestamp
*   **Summary of Work:** Established Python virtual environment (`venv`). Manually installed Python dependencies (consolidated list including LightRAG, ChromaDB, Sentence-Transformers, Torch - excluding `ragstack`) after tool execution failures (required Python 3.11 downgrade). Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`npm init -y`). Installed required Node.js dependencies (including `@dnd-kit/core`, excluding `n8n`, `react-beautiful-dnd`).

Updated `.gitignore` with Node-specific entries.
*   **Key Decisions/Rationale:** Proceeded with manual Python dependency installation after tool failures. Adapted to updated ESLint interactive prompts.
*   **Testing/Verification Outcome:** Checked requirements.txt, app/package.json, eslint config, .gitignore, and venv presence. Approved by Anthony.
*   **Issues Logged/Resolved:** Python dependency installation failures resolved via manual install and Python downgrade.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe:** Approved Day 2 completion. Noted tool execution issues.
*   **Next Task Context:** Proceeding to Day 3, Task: BaseAgent & Logging System.
