# DreamerAI Context Memory Aid

## Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Refined Configuration
*   **Summary**: Established base project structure in C:\DreamerAI. Initialized Git repository and linked to GitHub remote (TheCrypDough/DreamerAi). Created structured configuration files (`data/config/.env.development` for secrets, `data/config/config.dev.toml` for settings). Established symbolic link `data/models` -> `C:\Users\thecr\.ollama\models` (manually by user). Created `.gitignore` file. Pushed initial structure and configuration to GitHub.
*   **Key Decisions**: Adopted TOML for structured configuration alongside `.env` for secrets, preparing for flexible LLM loading (Day 6). Followed directory structure defined in rules.
*   **Anthony's Feedback/Vibe**: Initial setup approved after verifying GitHub push. Ready to proceed.
*   **Blocking Issues**: Encountered issues running multi-step script commands due to terminal modification/interruption. Switched to step-by-step execution. Required manual creation of symbolic link due to lack of Administrator privileges in terminal session.

## Day 2: Environment Setup & Core Dependencies (2025-04-10)

*   **Summary:** Established Python virtual environment (`venv/`) and installed core Python dependencies (`requirements.txt`) including FastAPI, Uvicorn, Ollama, RAGstack, Transformers, PyYAML, python-dotenv, etc. Initialized Node.js project in `app/` (`package.json`), installed core runtime dependencies (React, Electron, MUI, etc.) and development dependencies (`eslint`). Configured ESLint using the flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`) with Airbnb rules (via individual plugins due to v9 compatibility issues). Updated `.gitignore`.
*   **Key Decisions:** Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to install ESLint Airbnb plugins due to version conflict with ESLint v9. Adopted ESLint flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`).
*   **Anthony's Feedback:** Emphasized not "half-assing" the ESLint setup, requiring adherence to Airbnb standards. Noted terminal output issues.
*   **Blocking Issues:** Significant issues with `npm install` for ESLint plugins due to peer dependency conflicts (ESLint v9 vs Airbnb config) and unreliable terminal execution/output. Resolved by manually confirming installation via `package.json` and using `--legacy-peer-deps`. Initial Git commits were incomplete due to failed installations; corrected with a final comprehensive commit.
