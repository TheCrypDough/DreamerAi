Project Workflow

DreamerAi Comprehensive Project Workflow
The DreamerAi project lifecycle transforms a user’s initial idea into a fully functional, secure, and well-documented application through a structured, agent-driven process. Each phase builds on the previous one, with agents collaborating seamlessly via defined protocols and communication channels. This workflow assumes a hypothetical project (e.g., a web-based task management app) to illustrate concrete examples, but it is adaptable to any user request.

Phase 1: Input Phase
Objective: Capture the user’s project request and optimize it for clarity and efficiency.
Step 1.1: User Submission
Action: The user accesses the DreamerAi interface (a web-based portal or desktop app) and submits their project request.
Inputs:
Natural Language (NL) Chat: E.g., “I want a task management app with a clean UI, team collaboration, and deadline reminders.”
Attached Files: E.g., a PDF sketch of the desired UI, a CSV of sample tasks, or a text file with feature ideas.
Tools: The interface uses a rich text editor with file upload capabilities and real-time input validation.
Output: Raw user input (NL text + attachments) is sent to the Promptimizer via an API call.
Duration: Instantaneous submission (less than 1 second).
Step 1.2: Input Preprocessing
Agent: Promptimizer
Action: Analyzes and optimizes the raw input into a structured format called PrInput.
Process:
NL Optimization:
Parses NL text using an NLP model (e.g., BERT-based) to extract intent, entities (e.g., “task management,” “UI”), and sentiment.
Rephrases ambiguous phrases (e.g., “clean UI” → “minimalist, user-friendly interface”) for clarity.
Tags key terms with metadata (e.g., {feature: “team collaboration”, priority: “high”}).
Attachment Handling:
Converts PDFs to text via OCR if needed, extracts data from CSVs, and summarizes large files.
Compresses attachments (e.g., reducing a 10MB PDF to 1MB) using lossless algorithms, preserving all details.
Generates a context summary (e.g., “UI sketch: 3 pages, CSV: 50 tasks”).
Token Cost Management: Limits PrInput to 10,000 tokens; if exceeded, compresses further and notifies the user.
Tools: Custom NLP pipeline, OCR software (e.g., Tesseract), compression libraries (e.g., zlib).
Output: PrInput (JSON format, e.g., { "description": "Task management app...", "features": ["team collaboration", "deadline reminders"], "attachments": ["ui_sketch.pdf", "tasks.csv"] }).
Notification: If compressed, sends a message via the UI: “Your input was optimized for efficiency—nothing lost!”
Duration: 2–5 seconds, depending on input size.
Step 1.3: Input Handoff
Agent: Promptimizer → Jeff (Main Chat Agent)
Action: Promptimizer sends PrInput to Jeff via Hermie (Communications Agent) using a secure internal messaging queue (e.g., RabbitMQ).
Output: Jeff receives PrInput and logs the event in input_log.md.
Duration: Less than 1 second.

Phase 2: Refinement Phase
Objective: Refine the user’s project vision through interactive dialogue, tailored suggestions, and educational content.
Step 2.1: User Engagement Initiation
Agent: Jeff
Action: Starts a chat session with the user, displaying PrInput in a readable format (e.g., bullet points).
Message: “Hi! I’ve got your request for a task management app with team collaboration and reminders. Let’s refine it together—what’s your top priority?”
Tools: Chat UI with markdown rendering, real-time typing indicators.
Handoff: Sends PrInput to Sophia (Suggestions Agent) and Spark (Education Agent) via Hermie.
Duration: Ongoing until user responds.
Step 2.2: Suggestion Generation
Agent: Sophia
Action: Analyzes PrInput to propose enhancements.
Process:
Identifies gaps (e.g., no mention of mobile support) and opportunities (e.g., adding Kanban boards).
Requests real-time research from Riddick (Research Agent) via Hermie: “Find trends in task management apps, 2023.”
Tools: Rule-based suggestion engine, semantic analysis model.
Duration: 5–10 seconds (awaiting Riddick’s response).
Step 2.3: Educational Content Creation
Agent: Spark
Action: Analyzes PrInput to educate the user.
Process:
Detects novice terms (e.g., “clean UI” suggests UI/UX unfamiliarity).
Requests resources from Riddick: “Get a beginner’s guide to UI design and task app features.”
Tools: Content curation algorithm, markdown generator.
Duration: 5–10 seconds (awaiting Riddick’s response).
Step 2.4: Research Execution
Agent: Riddick
Action: Fulfills requests from Sophia and Spark.
Process:
Queries external sources (e.g., Google Scholar, GitHub, industry blogs) via APIs.
Returns:
To Sophia: “Trends: 80% of task apps offer mobile sync, 60% use Kanban.”
To Spark: “UI guide (5 pages), feature list (10 items).”
Tools: Web scraping tools, API wrappers (e.g., SerpAPI).
Output: Research data sent back via Hermie.
Duration: 5–15 seconds.
Step 2.5: Suggestion and Content Delivery
Agents: Sophia → Jeff, Spark → Jeff
Action:
Sophia: Sends suggestions (e.g., “Add mobile sync and Kanban boards?”) in a selectable list.
Spark: Sends content (e.g., “Here’s a UI guide and feature ideas.”) as clickable links or embedded markdown.
Tools: JSON-to-UI converter for interactive elements.
Output: Jeff displays outputs in chat:
“Suggestions: [ ] Mobile sync, [ ] Kanban boards.”
“Learn more: UI Guide (#), Feature Ideas (#).”
Duration: 1–2 seconds.
Step 2.6: Iterative Refinement Loop
Agent: Jeff
Action: Engages user in multi-turn dialogue.
Process:
User selects options (e.g., “Yes to mobile sync, no to Kanban”) and adds comments (e.g., “I want email reminders too”).
Jeff updates PrInput and repeats Steps 2.2–2.5 if new inputs require further suggestions or education.
Logs each iteration in refinement_log.md.
Decision Point: Continues until user says “Looks good” or similar.
Duration: 1–10 minutes, depending on user responsiveness.
Step 2.7: Final Output Handoff
Agent: Jeff → Hermie
Action: Once approved, Jeff finalizes the refined project output (e.g., “Task app with mobile sync, email reminders, clean UI”) and sends it to Hermie.
