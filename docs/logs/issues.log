[2025-04-10 21:55:00] - Issue Identified: `dreamer.db` file not created upon server start. Task: Day 5: SQLite Database & Basic UI Bridge. Reason: `DreamerDB` class was defined in `db.py` but not instantiated in `server.py`, so the connection method that creates the file was never called. Status: Fixing.
[2025-04-10 22:15:00] - Issue Resolved: `dreamer.db` file not created. Task: Day 5: SQLite Database & Basic UI Bridge. Fix: Imported and instantiated `DreamerDB` in `server.py`'s startup event. Verified file creation upon server restart.
[2025-04-10 22:05:00] - Issue Identified: Electron Security Warning (Insecure Content-Security-Policy) observed in DevTools console. Task: Day 5 (Observed during testing).

[2025-04-11 00:08:56] - Issue Identified: OpenRouter API call failed with 400 Bad Request. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Reason: The request sent to OpenRouter (using model 'meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf') was rejected by the server. Potential causes include incorrect model identifier string for the API key, missing required parameters, or incorrect request format. Status: Investigating (User to verify model identifier).
[2025-04-11 00:36:02] - Issue Resolved: OpenRouter API call failed with 400 Bad Request. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Fix: Corrected the `model_name` for `openrouter_cloud` provider in `config.dev.toml` to `openrouter/optimus-alpha` based on user feedback.
[2025-04-11 00:36:02] - Issue Identified: OpenRouter API key not found during initialization. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Reason: Previous edit to `config.dev.toml` incorrectly changed `api_key_env` to `api_key = "${...}"`. Status: Resolved.
[2025-04-11 00:36:02] - Issue Resolved: OpenRouter API key not found during initialization. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Fix: Corrected `config.dev.toml` to use `api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"` for the `openrouter_cloud` provider.
[2025-04-11 00:49:00] - Issue Identified: Persistent Ollama status check failure. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Reason: `_check_ollama_status` in `llm.py` consistently fails with 404 on `/api/generate` during test execution, despite code explicitly targeting the base URL (`self.ollama_base_url`). Multiple `edit_file` attempts to correct this path were either unsuccessful or reported "no changes needed", suggesting an external environment/tooling/caching issue preventing the correct code from executing. Ollama functionality cannot be tested reliably. Status: Blocked (Requires external investigation/resolution of environment/tooling).
[2025-04-11 01:35:00] - Issue Resolved: Persistent Ollama status check failure. Task: Day 6 Config-Driven Hybrid LLM Setup. Fix: User manually modified `engine/ai/llm.py` to force `_check_ollama_status` to *always* check the root Ollama URL (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/`) instead of deriving the path from the configured `base_url`. This bypasses the suspected environment/tooling issue that prevented previous code edits from taking effect.
[2025-04-11 02:40:00] - Issue Resolved: TypeError: DreamerLogger.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name', Task: Day 7 - Execute Nexus Test Block, Fix: Corrected nexus.py to import global logger_instance and use .patch() instead of direct instantiation.

[2025-04-11 02:52:00] - Issue Resolved: ValidationError: 1 validation error for Nexus llm Field required, Task: Day 7 - Execute Nexus Test Block, Fix: Corrected Nexus.__init__ to pass 'llm' in super().__init__ call.
[2025-04-11 02:58:00] - Issue Resolved: AttributeError: type object 'AgentState' has no attribute 'PROCESSING', Task: Day 7 - Execute Nexus Test Block, Fix: Changed AgentState.PROCESSING to AgentState.RUNNING in nexus.py.
[2025-04-11 03:05:00] - Issue Resolved: TypeError: LLM.generate() got an unexpected keyword argument 'config', Task: Day 7 - Execute Nexus Test Block, Fix: Changed nexus.py to pass 'messages' list and individual args (max_tokens, temperature) to LLM.generate().
[2025-04-11 03:55:00] - Issue Identified: Failed to update tasks.md with Day 8 tasks before starting Day 8 execution. Status: Correcting.
[2025-04-11 04:05:00] - Issue Resolved: Failed to update tasks.md with Day 8 tasks, Task: Day 8 Auto-Update Workflow, Fix: Verified tasks.md was actually updated correctly; git add failure caused confusion.

[2025-04-11 04:30:00] - Issue Resolved: `ImportError: ragstack library not found`. Task: Day 8.2. Fix: User confirmed `ragstack` package does not provide intended `RAGDatabase` functionality. Rewritten script using `sqlite3` as temporary fix.
[2025-04-11 04:32:00] - Decision: Rollback `sqlite3` approach for RAG seeding. Task: Day 8.2. Reason: Maintain architectural integrity; use proper vector DB (`ChromaDB`).
[2025-04-11 04:34:00] - Issue Identified: `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'persist'` when running ChromaDB seeding script. Task: Day 8.2. Reason: `client.persist()` is deprecated/removed in newer ChromaDB versions. Status: Fixing script.
[2025-04-11 04:35:00] - Issue Resolved: `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'persist'`. Task: Day 8.2. Fix: Removed `client.persist()` call from `scripts/seed_rag_jeff.py`. Verified successful ChromaDB seeding.
