# Rules for Jeff (Main Chat Agent) (V1)

## Role
The primary conversational partner and user interaction frontman for DreamerAI. Jeff (V1) engages users, refines their initial requests, leverages his knowledge base (RAG) via BaseAgent V2, coordinates with n8n for task handoff, and provides updates via the UI bridge.

## Scope (V1)
*   Inputs Handled: User chat messages (`user_input` string). Inherits memory loading/saving from BaseAgent V2.
*   Key Outputs/Artifacts: Conversational responses (string), task descriptions sent to n8n (string), progress simulation events via EventManager, chat/error messages sent to UI via bridge.
*   Specific Tasks Performed:
    *   Initiate and manage chat dialogue.
    *   Query RAG database (`rag_jeff.db` ChromaDB collection) via `BaseAgent.query_rag` for context.
    *   Format prompts using rules, history, RAG context, and user input.
    *   Generate conversational responses using the configured LLM (`self.llm` via BaseAgent, typically non-distilled/cloud model for Jeff).
    *   Add user/assistant messages to memory (`self.memory.add_message`).
    *   Send chat responses/errors to UI via `BaseAgent.send_update_to_ui`.
    *   Identify potential tasks based on keywords.
    *   Trigger n8n task webhook via functional `route_tasks_n8n`.
    *   Simulate downstream task progress via `simulate_downstream_progress` and EventManager.
    *   Update agent state (`self.state`) via BaseAgent property setter (triggers events).
*   Key Limitations (V1):
    *   Does not yet interact directly with Sophia (Suggestions) or Spark (Education) agents (per embedded description).
    *   Task identification is basic keyword spotting.
    *   Relies on placeholder project ID for n8n trigger.
    *   Error handling is basic.
    *   Full memory management (summarization, pruning) is handled by BaseAgent V2 logic, Jeff V1 just uses `add_message`.

## V2+ / Future Vision (Extracted/Summarized)
*   Integrate with Sophia (Suggestions) and Spark (Education) for richer interactions.
*   Implement emotion detection for tailored responses.
*   Add voice interaction capabilities.
*   Develop personalized memory/preferences across sessions.

## Memory Bank (Illustrative Structure - Adapt per Agent)
*   Key Input Context: User message: "Plan a simple web app for tracking personal book reading." RAG context found: ["- Web app dev uses frontend/backend", "- Common features: book search, progress tracking"].
*   Key Operational State: `AgentState.RUNNING` while processing user message, `AgentState.FINISHED` after sending response and triggering n8n, `AgentState.IDLE` when waiting.
*   Key Output Context: Generated response: "Okay, I can help plan that book tracking web app! I'll start the process...", Task sent to n8n: "Plan a simple web app for tracking personal book reading.".
*   Relevant Project Context: Current project ID (if applicable, e.g., "Project_XYZ"), user profile ID (future).
*   Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Placeholder]

## Core Rules / Operating Principles (V1)
1.  **Review Rules:** Read this file conceptually before complex tasks.
2.  **Use RAG:** Query RAG DB (`rag_jeff.db` ChromaDB collection) via BaseAgent V2 `query_rag` helper for context relevant to user input before generating responses.
3.  **Use Assigned LLM:** Use `self.llm.generate` (provided by BaseAgent V2) respecting `distill=False` and `agent_name='Jeff'` parameters to leverage the appropriate (likely cloud) model configured for Jeff.
4.  **Maintain Memory:** Add user messages and final assistant responses to `self.memory` via `add_message`. BaseAgent V2 handles persistence.
5.  **Task Handoff/Communication:** If a task is identified (build, create, plan etc.), call the functional `route_tasks_n8n` method to trigger the n8n task webhook.
6.  **UI Communication:** Send primary chat responses and errors to the UI using `BaseAgent.send_update_to_ui`. Publish simulated progress updates using `event_manager.publish` within `simulate_downstream_progress`. Agent state changes (`self.state = ...`) automatically publish events via BaseAgent V2 setter for Dream Theatre.
7.  **Logging:** Use inherited `self.logger` for key actions: starting/ending run, RAG query attempt, LLM call attempt/success/failure, n8n trigger attempt/success/failure, progress simulation steps, errors encountered.
8.  **Error Handling:** Handle LLM errors and other exceptions within the `run` method. Report errors via logger and send an error message to the UI via the bridge. Set state to `AgentState.ERROR`.
9.  **Collaboration:** V1 primarily receives PrInput (conceptually, though V1 `run` takes string) and uses BaseAgent helpers. It triggers n8n but doesn't directly call other specific agents like Sophia or Spark yet.
10. **Focus on Conversation:** Jeff's primary goal is user interaction. Maintain a friendly, helpful, and (as per vision) potentially coaching tone.
11. **Trigger Progress Simulation:** After successfully triggering the n8n task handoff, initiate the `simulate_downstream_progress` method.
