# Blueprint: FlowV2Test_D16_1744946783 - Basic Command-Line Timer App

**Project Summary:** This project aims to develop a basic command-line timer application. The timer will allow users to set, start, pause, resume, and reset timers. It should be straightforward to use and provide clear visual feedback in the terminal.

**Core Features:**

*   **Timer Setting:** Users can specify the timer duration (in seconds) via command-line arguments or interactive prompts.
*   **Start/Stop Functionality:** Users can start and stop the timer. The timer should display the remaining time.
*   **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Users can pause and resume the timer.  A clear indication of paused state is required.
*   **Reset Functionality:** A command to reset the timer back to its initial state (0 seconds).
*   **Display Remaining Time:** The application should continuously display the remaining time until the timer reaches zero.  When the timer reaches zero, a notification (e.g., a message in the terminal) should be displayed.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python (High-level, easy to learn, widely available libraries for terminal interaction and time management).
*   **Terminal Interaction:** `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing), `time` module (for time management), `sys` module (for terminal output)
*   **No Database Required:** This is a simple application; data persistence is not a core requirement.
*   **Alternative (Future Expansion - if persistence needed):** If future enhancements include saving timer presets, a lightweight file format (e.g., JSON) could be used for persistence, or SQLite.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1 Day):**
    *   Project Initialization: Create a new directory for the project and initialize a Git repository.
    *   Environment Setup: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
    *   Basic file structure: `main.py` (main application logic), `utils.py` (for helper functions, optional).

2.  **Command-Line Argument Parsing (0.5 Days):**
    *   Implement command-line argument parsing using `argparse` to handle timer duration input. Allow for both positional and optional arguments.
    *   Implement interactive prompts if no duration is provided as a command-line argument.

3.  **Timer Logic Implementation (1.5 Days):**
    *   Implement the core timer logic, including setting, starting, stopping, pausing, resuming, and resetting the timer.
    *   Implement the time display functionality.
    *   Handle edge cases (e.g., negative duration, zero duration).

4.  **Notification & Visual Feedback (0.5 Days):**
    *   Implement the notification upon timer completion (e.g., display a message in the terminal).
    *   Implement clear visual feedback for pause/resume state.

5.  **Testing & Refinement (1 Day):**
    *   Unit testing of key functions (e.g., timer start, stop, pause).
    *   Manual testing of the complete application workflow.
    *   Code review and refactoring.
    *   Address identified bugs and improve code readability.

6.  **Documentation (0.5 Day):**
    *   Add a basic README file explaining how to run the application and its usage.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Prototype Command-Line Argument Parsing:** Create a basic script to parse command-line arguments and print them back to the console. This focuses on initial setup and validation.
2.  **Implement Basic Timer Functionality:** Implement the core timer logic (setting, starting, stopping) without argument parsing. Focus on core time management.
3.  **Define Error Handling:** Consider what types of errors are possible (invalid input, etc.) and outline a plan for graceful error handling.
4.  **Git Commit Initial Structure:** Commit the initial directory structure and `main.py` with the most basic placeholder code to Git.
