Okay, DreamerAI, let's map out this command-line timer project. Here is the blueprint:

# Blueprint: FlowV2_LewisV1_Test_D17_1744950289

## Project Summary

To create a simple, functional command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to start, monitor, and be notified upon completion of a countdown timer.

## Core Features

1.  **Start Timer:** Initiate a timer for a user-specified duration (e.g., seconds, minutes). Input via command-line arguments (e.g., `timer 5m`, `timer 30s`).
2.  **Display Countdown:** Show the remaining time dynamically updating in the terminal window.
3.  **Completion Notification:** Provide a clear signal when the timer reaches zero (e.g., print a message like "Time's up!", potentially play a system beep if feasible).
4.  **Stop/Cancel Timer:** Allow the user to prematurely stop the currently running timer (e.g., using `Ctrl+C` or a specific command).
5.  **Basic Input Handling:** Parse time inputs and provide user-friendly error messages for invalid formats or durations.

## Potential Tech Stack

*   **Language:**
    *   **Python:** Excellent choice for CLI tools. Libraries like `argparse` (argument parsing), `time` (core timing), `curses` (more advanced dynamic display) or simple print with carriage return `\r` (basic dynamic display).
    *   **Node.js:** Suitable for async operations. Libraries like `yargs` or `commander` (argument parsing), `chalk` (styling output), standard `setInterval`/`setTimeout`.
    *   **Go:** Compiles to a single binary, good performance for CLI apps. Standard library (`flag`, `time`).
    *   **Rust:** Focus on performance and safety, good for robust CLI tools. Libraries like `clap` (arguments), `std::time`.
*   **Libraries (Example - Python):**
    *   `argparse`: For handling command-line arguments.
    *   `time`: For `sleep` and time calculations.
    *   (Optional) `beepy` or platform-specific commands for sound notification.
*   **Database:** Not required for this version. Timer state managed in memory.
*   **Frontend/Backend:** Not applicable in the traditional web sense. The terminal is the interface.

## High-Level Steps

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Choose the programming language.
    *   Initialize the project directory structure.
    *   Set up necessary environment (e.g., Python virtual environment, Node.js `package.json`).
    *   Install any initial dependencies (e.g., argument parsing library).
2.  **Argument Parsing:**
    *   Implement logic to accept and validate the timer duration from command-line arguments.
    *   Define commands (e.g., implicit `start` based on duration argument).
3.  **Core Timer Logic:**
    *   Implement the countdown mechanism using the chosen language's time functions.
4.  **Display Logic:**
    *   Implement the functionality to clear the current line and reprint the updated remaining time in the terminal.
5.  **Completion Handling:**
    *   Add logic to detect when the timer finishes.
    *   Implement the completion notification (message, optional sound).
6.  **Control & Error Handling:**
    *   Implement graceful exit/stop functionality (e.g., handling `KeyboardInterrupt` in Python).
    *   Add error handling for invalid time formats or other potential issues.
7.  **Testing:**
    *   Perform manual testing with various valid and invalid inputs.
    *   (Optional) Write automated unit tests for parsing and timer logic if desired.
8.  **Refinement & Packaging (Optional):**
    *   Refactor code for clarity and efficiency.
    *   Make the script easily executable (e.g., add shebang, use `setuptools`/`pip` for Python, `npm link` or package for Node.js).

## Next Steps

1.  **Select Technology:** Decide on the primary programming language (Python is often a good starting point for CLI tools).
2.  **Initialize Project:** Create the project folder and set up the basic environment (e.g., `git init`, create `main.py` or `index.js`, set up `venv` or `npm init`).
3.  **Implement Argument Parsing:** Start by writing the code to accept the timer duration as a command-line argument using a library like `argparse` (Python) or `yargs` (Node.js).
