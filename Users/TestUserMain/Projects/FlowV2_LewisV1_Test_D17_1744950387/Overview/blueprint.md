# Blueprint: FlowV2_LewisV1_Test_D17_1744950387 - Basic Command-Line Timer App

**Project Summary:** This project aims to create a simple, command-line timer application that allows users to set, start, pause, and stop timers with customizable durations. The application will be accessible and functional from any terminal environment.  The goal is a functional, usable timer, not a visually elaborate one.

**Core Features:**

*   **Timer Creation:** Users can create timers by specifying a duration in seconds.  The command should be in the format: `timer create <duration_seconds>`.
*   **Timer Start/Stop:** Users can start and stop timers individually by name (each timer should be uniquely named during creation). Commands: `timer start <timer_name>` and `timer stop <timer_name>`.
*   **Pause/Resume:** Users can pause and resume timers.  Command: `timer pause <timer_name>` and `timer resume <timer_name>`.
*   **Timer Listing:** Users can list all active timers, displaying their names and remaining durations. Command: `timer list`.
*   **Timer Deletion:**  Users can delete timers. Command: `timer delete <timer_name>`.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python - chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support suitable for CLI applications.
*   **CLI Framework (Optional):** `Click` or `Argparse` (Python) - These help in parsing command-line arguments in a structured and maintainable way.  `Argparse` is built-in, reducing dependencies.
*   **Data Storage (Minimal):**  No database is initially required. Timer data (name, duration, status) will be stored in memory (Python dictionaries).  Consider JSON file storage for persistence in later iterations.
*   **Notification (Optional):** `playsound` or similar library to play a simple sound when a timer expires.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   Project Initialization: Create a new Python project directory and initialize a virtual environment.
    *   Dependency Management: Install `argparse` (or Click if preferred) and any other initial dependencies.
    *   Basic CLI Structure:  Create the initial script (`main.py` or similar) with basic argument parsing for the "help" command.
2.  **Timer Creation & Parsing (1-2 days):**
    *   Implement the `timer create` command.  Validate the input duration (positive integer).
    *   Store timer data in memory (Python dictionary). Assign unique names automatically if no name is provided.
3.  **Timer Start/Stop/Pause/Resume Logic (2-3 days):**
    *   Implement the core timer logic. This includes starting the timer thread, handling pausing and resuming, and counting down the timer duration.
    *   Implement the `timer start`, `timer stop`, `timer pause`, and `timer resume` commands, referencing the timers stored in memory.
4.  **Timer Listing Functionality (1 day):**
    *   Implement the `timer list` command to display active timers and their remaining durations.  Format the output clearly.
5.  **Timer Deletion Functionality (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Implement the `timer delete` command to remove timers from the active list.  Handle cases where the timer doesnâ€™t exist.
6.  **Testing (1-2 days):**
    *   Unit Tests: Create unit tests for core timer functions (start, stop, pause, resume, delete).
    *   Integration Tests:  Test the complete workflow from creation to deletion.
    *   Edge Case Testing: Test with zero durations, negative durations, very long durations, concurrent commands.
7.  **Refinement and Documentation (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Improve error handling and user feedback.
    *   Write basic documentation (README) outlining usage.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Proof of Concept (1 day):** Create a minimal working version with just the `timer create`, `timer start`, and `timer stop` functionality. This will allow initial testing of the core timer logic.
2.  **Dependency Selection:** Decide whether to use `argparse` (built-in) or `Click` for command-line argument parsing. Research both briefly to determine the most suitable choice for maintainability.
3.  **Initial Code Repository Setup:** Create a Git repository for the project and push the initial proof-of-concept code. This establishes version control from the beginning.
4.  **Refine the requirements**:  Consider whether more complex error handling (e.g., handling of invalid timers) is required at this early stage.
