# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_112857 - Word Counter CLI Tool (V1)

**Project Summary:**

This project aims to develop a simple, command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python that counts the words within a specified text file.  The tool will accept a file path as input and output the total word count.  Version 1 (V1) will focus on core functionality and basic error handling.

**Core Features:**

*   **File Input:** The tool must accept a file path as a command-line argument.
*   **Word Counting:**  Accurately count the number of words within the specified file.  This includes handling different types of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
*   **Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle scenarios where:
    *   The file does not exist.
    *   The provided path is not a valid file.
    *   The file is empty.
*   **Output:** Display the word count to the user in a clear and readable format (e.g., "Word count: [number]").
*   **Help/Usage Message:**  Provide a help message displayed when the tool is invoked with `-h` or `--help`, explaining the usage and required arguments.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python 3.9+ (for f-strings and other modern features)
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments.  This is part of the Python standard library.
    *   `os`:  For interacting with the operating system, primarily for file path validation. Part of Python Standard Library.
*   **Environment:**
    *   Virtual Environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) - Essential for dependency management.  Recommended for all Python projects.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   Create a new Python project directory.
    *   Initialize a virtual environment.
    *   Create the initial project file structure (e.g., `main.py`).
    *   Basic testing setup (e.g., a simple test file).
2.  **Command-Line Argument Parsing (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Implement argument parsing using `argparse`.
    *   Define the required argument (file path).
    *   Implement the `--help` message.
3.  **File Handling & Word Counting Logic (1-2 days):**
    *   Implement the logic to read the specified file.
    *   Implement the word counting algorithm:
        *   Open the file.
        *   Read the contents into a string.
        *   Split the string into words using whitespace as a delimiter.  Consider using `string.split()` and handling multiple whitespace characters.
        *   Count the number of words in the resulting list.
4.  **Error Handling (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Implement error handling for:
        *   File Not Found Error (`FileNotFoundError`).
        *   Permission Errors.
        *   Invalid file path.
5.  **Output & Formatting (0.5 day):**
    *   Format the output to display the word count clearly.
6.  **Testing (1 day):**
    *   Write unit tests to verify correct functionality:
        *   Test with an empty file.
        *   Test with a file containing only whitespace.
        *   Test with a file containing multiple whitespace characters between words.
        *   Test with a standard text file.
        *   Test error handling.
7.  **Deployment (0.5 day):**
    *   Simple deployment:  Ensure the script can be executed directly from the command line.  (No formal deployment initially)

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**  Create a new Python project directory and initialize a virtual environment.
2.  **`argparse` Implementation:**  Write the code to parse the command-line arguments using `argparse`. Focus on defining the required file path argument and the help message.  Create a basic `main.py` file.
3.  **File Reading and Simple Word Counting (Proof of Concept):** Implement the file reading and a basic word counting algorithm (splitting by space) to ensure you can read the file content.
4.  **Create Test File:** Create a small test file with various scenarios (empty file, file with whitespace only, file with multiple words)
