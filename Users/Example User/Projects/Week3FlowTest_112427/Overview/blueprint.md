# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_112427

**Project Summary:**
This project aims to develop Version 1 (V1) of 'Week3FlowTest_112427', a straightforward command-line interface (CLI) tool using Python. The primary function of this tool will be to accept a file path as input and output the total word count within that file.

**Core Features (V1):**

1.  **File Input:** Accept a single file path as a command-line argument.
2.  **File Reading:** Open and read the contents of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting:** Process the file content to count the number of words. (Initial definition: words separated by whitespace).
4.  **Result Output:** Display the final word count clearly on the console.
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle common errors like the file not being found or being unreadable, providing informative messages to the user.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing - standard library)
    *   `os` or `pathlib` (for file path validation/handling - standard library)
