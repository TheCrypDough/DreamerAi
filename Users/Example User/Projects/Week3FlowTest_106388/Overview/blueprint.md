# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_106388 - Word Counter CLI Tool (V1)

**Project Summary:**

This project aims to create a simple, command-line interface (CLI) tool in Python (Week3FlowTest_106388) that counts the number of words in a user-specified file.  Version 1 (V1) will focus on core functionality and robustness.

**Core Features:**

*   **File Input:**  The tool must accept a file path as a command-line argument.
*   **Error Handling (Invalid File):**  Gracefully handle cases where the provided file path is invalid or the file does not exist. Display a helpful error message.
*   **Word Counting:** Accurately count the words in the specified file, handling common punctuation and whitespace.
*   **Output Display:**  Display the word count to the user in a clear and concise manner (e.g., "The file contains [number] words.").
*   **Basic Usage Help:** Provide a brief help message when the tool is invoked with a `-h` or `--help` flag, outlining usage instructions.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+ (preferred for modern features and library support)
*   **CLI Parsing:** `argparse` (Python's standard library for creating command-line interfaces) - provides robust argument parsing and help generation.
*   **File Handling:** Python's built-in `open()` function for reading files.
*   **Text Processing:** Python's `string` and `re` (regular expression) modules for text cleaning and word separation.
*   **No External Database:** For this V1, no database is required as all data is processed in memory.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1 Day):**
    *   Create a new Python project directory.
    *   Initialize a `main.py` file.
    *   Set up a basic project structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/` folders for organization).
    *   Initialize a Git repository (essential for version control).
    *   Create a `requirements.txt` file (even if it's initially empty - important for dependency management).
2.  **CLI Argument Parsing (0.5 Day):**
    *   Implement the `argparse` module to handle the file path argument.
    *   Define the `-h` or `--help` flag and its associated help message.
    *   Validate that a file path is provided.
3.  **File Reading and Error Handling (1 Day):**
    *   Implement file reading using `open()` with appropriate error handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`).
    *   Display user-friendly error messages for invalid or inaccessible files.
4.  **Word Counting Logic (1.5 Days):**
    *   Develop the core word counting algorithm. This will involve reading the file content, splitting the content into words, and counting the resulting elements.  Consider using `string.punctuation` and `re.split()` for cleaning.
    *   Test the word counting algorithm with various test files (empty files, files with punctuation, files with multiple whitespace characters, etc.).
5.  **Output Formatting (0.5 Day):**
    *   Format the output to display the word count clearly.
6.  **Testing (1 Day):**
    *   Create a suite of unit tests using Python's `unittest` module (or `pytest` - an alternative testing framework) to verify the correctness of the word counting logic.
    *   Include tests for edge cases and error conditions.
7.  **Documentation (0.5 Day):**
    *   Add a basic README.md file explaining how to use the tool.
    *   Add inline comments in the code explaining key logic.
8.  **Deployment (0.5 Day):**
    *   Create a simple installation script (e.g., `setup.py`) to allow users to easily install the tool.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Setup the Project:** Create the project directory, initialize Git, and create the `main.py` file.
2.  **Implement CLI Argument Parsing:**  Start with the `argparse` module and define the file path argument and help flag.  Focus on getting the basic structure working.
3.  **Write Preliminary Tests:**  Even before completing the core logic, write some basic tests for argument parsing. This helps establish a testing framework early on.
