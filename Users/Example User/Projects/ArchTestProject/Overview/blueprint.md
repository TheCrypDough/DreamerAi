# Blueprint: ArchTestProject - Personal Blog

**Project Summary:**

The ArchTestProject is a personal blog designed to be a showcase for AI and software development projects, with a focus on documenting and reflecting on learning experiences. It aims to be simple to use, easily customizable, and adaptable to future growth, demonstrating best practices and potentially incorporating AI-powered features down the line.

**Core Features:**

*   **Blog Post Creation & Editing:**  A user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and publishing blog posts, including rich text formatting (e.g., images, code snippets, lists, links).
*   **Categorization & Tagging:** Ability to categorize posts and assign tags for easier navigation and content organization.
*   **Basic User Authentication (Future Expansion):** Initially for administrative control (posting/editing), with potential for public user accounts and commenting later.
*   **Clean & Responsive Design:**  A visually appealing and functional design that works well on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for blog posts based on keywords or tags.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React (Offers component-based architecture, strong community, and good performance) or Vue.js (Easy to learn and use, great for smaller projects) - *Decision based on team familiarity.*
    *   **Styling:** Styled Components or Tailwind CSS (for rapid development and maintainable styles).
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript throughout the stack), or Python with Flask/Django (for quick prototyping and broader Python ecosystem).  *Node.js offers consistency with React.*
    *   **API:** RESTful API design.
*   **Database:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** (Relational, robust, good for structured data - preferred).
    *   **MongoDB:** (NoSQL, flexible for evolving data structures â€“ viable alternative).
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Platform:**  Netlify or Vercel (for easy frontend deployment). Heroku or AWS (for backend and database).  *Netlify/Vercel for simplicity.*

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup & Foundation (1-2 Days):**
    *   Project Initialization:  Create repository, set up basic project structure.
    *   Environment Configuration: Configure development environment (Node.js/Python, database).
    *   Basic Backend API:  Implement initial API endpoints (e.g., health check).
2.  **UI Design & Frontend Development (3-5 Days):**
    *   Design Wireframes & Mockups:  Create a basic visual layout for key pages (homepage, blog post page, editor).
    *   Frontend Component Development: Build out the main UI components (navigation, blog list, post display, editor elements).
    *   Responsive Design Implementation: Ensure UI is responsive across various devices.
3.  **Backend Logic & API Development (5-7 Days):**
    *   Database Schema Design: Define the database schema for blog posts, categories, and tags.
    *   API Endpoints: Develop API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Implement category and tag management.
    *   Authentication Middleware:  Implement basic authentication for administrative access (posting/editing).
4.  **Integration & Testing (2-3 Days):**
    *   Frontend/Backend Integration: Connect the frontend components to the backend API.
    *   Unit Testing: Write unit tests for backend logic and frontend components.
    *   Integration Testing: Test the interaction between frontend and backend.
5.  **Deployment & Monitoring (1 Day):**
    *   Deploy Frontend to Netlify/Vercel.
    *   Deploy Backend and Database to Heroku/AWS.
    *   Set up basic monitoring (logs, error tracking).

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Tech Stack Decision:** Finalize the specific technologies to be used based on team expertise and project needs. (React/Vue, Node/Python)
2.  **Database Schema Design (Detailed):** Create a detailed database schema, considering data types, relationships, and indexing.
3.  **Basic Frontend Prototype:**  Build a very simple frontend prototype with basic navigation and a placeholder blog post to visualize the initial design.
4.  **Set up Git Repository:**  Create a private Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab) for version control.
