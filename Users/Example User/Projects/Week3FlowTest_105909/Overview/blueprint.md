# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_105909 - Word Counter CLI

**Role:** Arch - DreamerAI Project Planner

## Project Summary

This project aims to develop a simple, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) tool in Python that accurately counts the number of words within a given text file.  The tool, 'Week3FlowTest_105909', will focus on core functionality and ease of use for V1.

## Core Features

*   **File Input:**  Accept a file path as a command-line argument.
*   **Word Counting:** Accurately count words within the input file.  This includes handling various whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).  Consider edge cases (empty file, file not found).
*   **Output Display:**  Clearly display the total word count to the user in the console.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provide informative error messages for invalid file paths or other issues.
*   **Help Message:**  Provide a concise help message when the tool is run with `-h` or `--help` arguments.

## Potential Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python (due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and suitability for CLI tools)
*   **CLI Parsing:** `argparse` (built-in Python module for easy command-line argument parsing)
*   **No External Dependencies (V1):**  Aim to avoid external packages to simplify initial deployment and reduce complexity.  This will be reevaluated in future versions.
*   **Operating System:** Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) should be a design goal.

## High-Level Steps

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   Initialize project repository (Git).
    *   Set up basic project structure (e.g., a single Python file initially).
    *   Install Python if necessary (ensure consistent Python version across development environments).
    *   Basic environment setup (virtual environment is highly recommended).
2.  **CLI Argument Parsing (0.5 days):**
    *   Implement `argparse` to handle the file path argument and the `--help` argument.
    *   Ensure argument parsing is robust and handles missing/invalid arguments gracefully.
3.  **File Input & Error Handling (1 day):**
    *   Implement file opening and reading logic.
    *   Implement error handling for file not found, permission errors, and other potential I/O issues.
4.  **Word Counting Logic (1 day):**
    *   Develop the core word counting algorithm. Consider using `split()` with appropriate whitespace handling or a more sophisticated tokenizer if needed in future iterations.
    *   Handle edge cases: empty files, files with only whitespace.
5.  **Output Display (0.5 day):**
    *   Format the word count output and display it to the user in a clear and concise manner.
6.  **Testing (1 day):**
    *   Create a suite of unit tests to verify the functionality of the word counter.  Focus on different file types, edge cases, and error handling.
    *   Conduct manual testing with various input files.
7.  **Documentation (0.5 day):**
    *   Write a basic README file explaining how to use the tool.
    *   Add comments to the code.
8.  **Deployment (0.5 day):**
    *   Create an executable for the CLI tool (e.g., using `pyinstaller` if cross-platform deployment is required).  For V1, simple distribution via shared repository is sufficient.

## Next Steps

1.  **Repository Initialization:** Create a new Git repository for 'Week3FlowTest_105909'.
2.  **Core File Creation:** Create the main Python file (e.g., `word_counter.py`).
3.  **`argparse` Implementation:** Implement the command-line argument parsing using `argparse` to accept the file path.  This is the highest priority.
4.  **Basic Test File:** Create a small text file for initial testing.
5.  **Define initial unit tests:**  Create a skeleton test file to begin the testing framework, even if initially containing only simple assertions.
