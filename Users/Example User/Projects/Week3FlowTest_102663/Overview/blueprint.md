# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_102663 - Word Counter CLI Tool (V1)

**Project Summary:**

This project aims to develop a simple, command-line interface (CLI) tool in Python that accurately counts the words within a specified text file. V1 will focus on core functionality and basic error handling.

**Core Features:**

*   **File Input:**  The tool must accept a file path as a command-line argument.
*   **Word Counting:**  Accurately count the words in the provided file. "Word" is defined as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.
*   **Output Display:** Display the total word count to the user in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Basic Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle cases where the specified file does not exist, cannot be opened, or is empty. Provide informative error messages.
*   **Usage Information:**  Provide helpful usage information (e.g., `--help` flag) explaining how to use the CLI tool.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python 3.8+ (for broader compatibility and modern features).
*   **CLI Framework:** `argparse` (built-in, simple and effective for this scope).  Alternatives: `click` (for more complex CLI apps, but likely overkill for V1).
*   **Text Processing:** Python's built-in string manipulation functions (`split()`, `strip()`).  No external libraries are initially required.
*   **Operating System:** Cross-platform (should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification).

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   Create a new Python project directory.
    *   Initialize a basic project structure (e.g., a single `main.py` file).
    *   Set up basic version control (Git).
2.  **Argument Parsing (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Implement the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments, including the file path.  Implement a `--help` flag.
3.  **File Handling & Error Handling (1 - 1.5 days):**
    *   Write code to open the specified file.
    *   Implement error handling for file not found, permission errors, and empty files.
4.  **Word Counting Logic (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Read the file content line by line.
    *   Split each line into words using whitespace as a delimiter.
    *   Accumulate the total word count.
5.  **Output Formatting & Display (0.5 days):**
    *   Format the output to clearly display the total word count to the user.
6.  **Testing (1 day):**
    *   Create a suite of test cases, including:
        *   Valid files of various sizes.
        *   Files with unusual whitespace.
        *   Non-existent files.
        *   Files with incorrect permissions.
    *   Implement unit tests for core logic.
7. **Documentation (0.5 day)**
    *   Add a README with basic usage instructions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Environment Setup:** Create a virtual environment for the project (using `venv` or `conda`).
2.  **Core Logic Skeleton:** Create a basic `main.py` file with an `argparse` setup, a placeholder for file handling, and a placeholder for the word counting logic.
3.  **Initial File Handling:** Implement the file opening and error handling logic using `try...except` blocks. Test these error handling scenarios.
4.  **Git Repository:**  Initialize a Git repository and push the initial setup to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
