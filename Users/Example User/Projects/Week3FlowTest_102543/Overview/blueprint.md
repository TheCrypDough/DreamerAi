# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_102543 - Word Counter CLI Tool (V1)

**Project Summary:**

This project aims to develop a simple, command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python. The tool, tentatively named 'wordcountcli', will take a file path as input and accurately count the number of words within that file, displaying the total count to the user. This is a foundational project aimed at assessing project flow and development processes.

**Core Features:**

*   **File Input:** Accepts a file path as a command-line argument.
*   **Word Counting:** Accurately counts words within the specified file.  Words will be delimited by whitespace.
*   **Error Handling:** Handles invalid file paths (file does not exist, incorrect permissions) gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.
*   **Output Display:** Clearly displays the total word count to the user on the command line.
*   **Basic Usage Help:**  Provides a brief help message when invoked with incorrect arguments or a `--help` flag, describing the tool's purpose and usage.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python 3.9+ (maintained and widely supported)
*   **CLI Parsing:** `argparse` (built-in Python library; ideal for simple CLI argument parsing)
*   **Text Processing:** Standard Python string manipulation and file I/O capabilities.  No external libraries required for basic functionality.
*   **Testing:** `unittest` (built-in Python library) or `pytest` (more feature-rich testing framework â€“ considered for future iterations)
*   **Version Control:** Git (essential for tracking changes and collaboration)

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1 day):**
    *   Initialize a Git repository for the project.
    *   Set up a basic project directory structure (e.g., `wordcountcli/`, `tests/`).
    *   Create a `README.md` file with a basic project description.
2.  **CLI Argument Parsing (0.5 days):**
    *   Implement the `argparse` functionality to handle the file path argument.
    *   Implement the `--help` flag functionality.
3.  **File Reading & Word Counting (1 day):**
    *   Write a function to open the specified file and read its contents.
    *   Implement the core word counting logic. Consider edge cases such as empty files and files with only whitespace.
4.  **Error Handling (0.5 days):**
    *   Implement error handling for invalid file paths (file not found, permission denied).
    *   Provide clear and informative error messages to the user.
5.  **Output and Formatting (0.5 day):**
    *   Format the output to clearly display the total word count.
6.  **Testing (1 day):**
    *   Write unit tests to verify the core functionality, including test cases for empty files, files with special characters, and invalid file paths.  Focus on boundary conditions and common error scenarios.
7.  **Code Review & Refactoring (0.5 day):**
    *   Review the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to Pythonic conventions.
    *   Refactor the code as needed.
8.  **Deployment (N/A for V1):**  V1 will focus on functionality, not distribution.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**  Create a virtual environment for the project (`python3 -m venv .venv`). Activate it.
2.  **Initial Code Skeleton:**  Create the main `wordcountcli.py` file and implement the basic `argparse` setup and a placeholder function for the core word counting logic.  Commit this initial commit.
3.  **File Reading Implementation:** Implement the file reading functionality within `wordcountcli.py`.
4.  **Create Initial Test File:**  Create a test file (`test.txt`) with a variety of word patterns to test the word counting logic.
5.  **Code Review and Branching Strategy:**  Discuss branching strategy with team and implement. (e.g., feature branches)
