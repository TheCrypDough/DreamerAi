Okay, DreamerAI team, let's get this blueprint drafted for 'Week3FlowTest_13160'. Hereâ€™s the initial plan:

```markdown
# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_13160 (V1)

## Project Summary
To develop `Week3FlowTest_13160`, a Version 1 command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Python. The primary function of this tool will be to accept a file path as input and output the total word count contained within that file.

## Core Features (V1)
1.  **Command-Line Argument Parsing:** Accept a single mandatory argument: the path to the input file.
2.  **File Reading:** Open and read the contents of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting Logic:** Implement logic to split the file content into words and count them. (Initial definition: split by whitespace).
4.  **Output Display:** Print the final word count clearly to the standard output (console).
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle common errors gracefully, such as "File Not Found" or "Permission Denied", providing informative messages to the user.

## Potential Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** N/A (This is a CLI application). Command-line argument parsing will be handled by Python libraries.
*   **Backend/Core Logic:**
    *   **Language:** Python (3.8+)
    *   **Libraries:**
        *   `argparse` (standard library) or `click` (third-party) for CLI argument handling.
        *   Standard Python file I/O operations.
*   **Database:** N/A (No data persistence required for V1).

## High-Level Steps
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create the main project directory (`Week3FlowTest_13160`).
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment.
    *   Initialize a Git repository for version control.
    *   Create necessary files (`main.py` or similar, `README.md`, `.gitignore`).
2.  **CLI Interface Implementation:**
    *   Integrate `argparse` or `click` to define and parse the required file path argument.
3.  **Core Logic Development:**
    *   Implement the function to open and read the file content.
    *   Implement the word counting algorithm.
    *   Add basic error handling (try-except blocks for file operations).
4.  **Integration & Output:**
    *   Connect the argument parser, file reading, and word counting logic.
    *   Format and print the final count to the console.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Create sample text files with known word counts.
    *   Manually test the CLI tool with valid files, non-existent files, and potentially empty files.
    *   (Optional V1 Extension) Write basic automated unit tests for the counting logic and error handling.
6.  **Documentation & Refinement:**
    *   Write instructions in `README.md` on how to install and run the tool.
    *   Refactor code for clarity and efficiency.

## Next Steps
1.  **Create Project Structure:** Execute Step 1 (Project Setup) - create the directory, virtual environment, and initialize Git.
2.  **Basic Script:** Create the main Python script file (e.g., `word_counter.py` or `main.py`).
3.  **Implement Argument Parsing:** Add the initial code using `argparse` to accept the file path argument.
