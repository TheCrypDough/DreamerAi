Okay, DreamerAI team, let's map out the plan for this project. Here is the initial blueprint for V1 of 'Week3FlowTest_109349'.

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_109349 - CLI Word Counter

## Project Summary
The goal of this project (V1) is to create a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool using Python that takes a file path as input and outputs the total word count found within that file.

## Core Features (V1)
1.  **Command Line Argument Parsing:** Accept a file path as a required argument when running the script (e.g., `python word_counter.py my_document.txt`).
2.  **File Reading:** Open and read the contents of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting Logic:** Process the text content to count the number of words. A simple definition of a word (e.g., split by whitespace) will suffice for V1.
4.  **Output Display:** Print the final word count clearly to the standard output (e.g., "File 'my_document.txt' contains 1234 words.").
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Implement checks for common errors, specifically:
    *   File not found.
    *   Incorrect number/type of arguments provided.

## Potential Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   `argparse` (Standard Library): For handling command-line arguments.
    *   Standard Python file I/O functions.
*   **Frontend:** N/A (CLI application)
*   **Backend:** N/A (Self-contained script)
*   **Database:** N/A (No data persistence needed for V1)
*   **Testing:** `unittest` or `pytest` (Optional but recommended for robustness)

## High-Level Steps
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create the main project directory (`Week3FlowTest_109349`).
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment.
    *   Initialize a Git repository for version control.
    *   Create the main Python script file (e.g., `word_counter.py`).
    *   Create a `README.md` file.
2.  **CLI Argument Handling:**
    *   Import `argparse`.
    *   Define the expected command-line argument (file path).
    *   Parse the arguments provided when the script is run.
3.  **File Processing:**
    *   Implement a function to open and read the file specified by the argument.
    *   Include error handling (e.g., `try...except FileNotFoundError`).
4.  **Word Counting:**
    *   Implement a function that takes the file content (string) as input.
    *   Split the string into words (e.g., using `text.split()`).
    *   Return the count of the resulting list elements.
5.  **Integration & Output:**
    *   Connect the steps: Get file path -> Read file -> Count words -> Print result.
    *   Format the output message clearly.
    *   Handle potential errors gracefully and provide informative messages.
6.  **Testing (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Write simple test cases:
        *   Test word counting logic with sample strings.
        *   Test file not found error handling.
        *   Test argument parsing.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` with instructions on how to install dependencies (if any) and run the tool.

## Next Steps
1.  **Create Project Structure:** Set up the main directory, virtual environment, and initialize Git.
2.  **Implement Argument Parsing:** Start coding `word_counter.py` by implementing the argument parsing using `argparse` to accept the file path.
3.  **Basic File Reading:** Add the initial file reading logic (without word counting yet) and basic `FileNotFoundError` handling.
