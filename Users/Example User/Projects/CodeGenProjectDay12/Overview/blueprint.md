# Blueprint: Simple Counter Web App

**Project Summary:** This project aims to create a basic web application featuring a counter displayed on the frontend (React) and a minimal backend (FastAPI) to potentially extend functionality in the future. The primary focus is a functional, working application with a clean and understandable codebase.

**Core Features:**

*   **Counter Display:**  A clear display of a numerical counter value on the frontend.
*   **Increment Button:** A button that increases the counter value by a predefined step (e.g., 1).
*   **Decrement Button:** A button that decreases the counter value by a predefined step (e.g., 1).
*   **Initial Value:** The counter should start with a predefined initial value (e.g., 0).
*   **(Future Extension Point):** Placeholder for future backend interaction (e.g., saving/loading counters from a database).

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Provides component-based architecture and a reactive approach.
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For React component logic. TypeScript is recommended for type safety as the project grows.
    *   **CSS/Styled Components/Material UI:** For styling the application. Styled Components offers a component-centric approach to styling, Material UI provides pre-built components.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **FastAPI:** Modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Excellent for rapid development.
    *   **Python 3.9+:** Programming language for the backend logic.
*   **Database (Future Expansion):**
    *   **SQLite:**  Simple, file-based database suitable for small-scale data storage.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** A more robust relational database if future requirements expand beyond basic file storage.
*   **Package Manager:**
    *   **npm/yarn/pnpm:** For managing JavaScript dependencies.  pnpm is recommended for efficiency and deterministic builds.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   Initialize the React frontend project (using `create-react-app` or a similar tool).
    *   Initialize the FastAPI backend project.
    *   Set up version control (Git).
    *   Choose a coding style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript).
2.  **UI Design & Implementation (2-3 days):**
    *   Design the basic UI layout (counter display, increment/decrement buttons).
    *   Implement the React components for displaying the counter and handling button clicks.
    *   Implement initial styling (CSS/Styled Components/Material UI).
3.  **Backend Logic (0.5-1 day):**
    *   Define a simple API endpoint in FastAPI (placeholder for now; can return a static value or a simple JSON).  This is essentially a minimal structure for future expansion.
4.  **Integration (1 day):**
    *   Connect the React frontend to the FastAPI backend (minimal interaction, likely just fetching a static value initially).
5.  **Testing (1 day):**
    *   Unit tests for React components (ensure increment/decrement logic works correctly).
    *   Basic API testing (using `curl` or a tool like Postman) to verify the backend is serving responses.
6.  **Deployment (0.5 - 1 day):**
    *   Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
    *   Deploy the backend to a simple server (e.g., Heroku, PythonAnywhere). (For this basic version, a local server is acceptable).

**Next Steps:**

*   **Immediate:**  Set up the React project using `create-react-app` and initialize the FastAPI project.
*   **Next:** Implement the counter display and increment/decrement buttons in the React frontend. Focus on basic functionality first.
*   **Then:** Define a basic API endpoint in FastAPI that returns a JSON object containing the current counter value (even if it's hardcoded).
*   **After that:** Integrate the frontend and backend, fetching the initial counter value from the API.
*   **Document:** Begin documenting the project, including decisions made and any potential future improvements.
