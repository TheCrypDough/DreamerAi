Okay, DreamerAI team, let's get this project planned out. Here is the blueprint for `Week3FlowTest_106638`.

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_106638

**Project Summary:** To design, develop, and deliver Version 1 (V1) of `Week3FlowTest_106638`, a command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Python. The primary function of this tool is to accept a file path as input and output the total word count contained within that file.

**Core Features (V1):**

1.  **Command-Line Interface:** The tool must be executable from the command line.
2.  **File Path Argument:** Accept a single mandatory argument representing the path to the input text file.
3.  **File Reading:** Read the contents of the specified text file.
4.  **Word Counting:** Implement logic to count the words within the file content. (V1 definition: words separated by whitespace).
5.  **Output Result:** Print the final word count clearly to the standard output (console).
6.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle common errors gracefully, specifically if the input file does not exist or cannot be read, providing informative messages to the user.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   `argparse` (Standard Library): For parsing command-line arguments.
    *   Built-in file I/O (`open()`): For reading the file.
    *   Built-in string methods (`split()`): For basic word tokenization.
*   **Frontend:** N/A (CLI application)
*   **Backend:** N/A (Self-contained script)
*   **Database:** N/A (No data persistence required)
*   **Testing:** `unittest` or `pytest` (Optional but recommended for robustness)

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a dedicated project directory (`Week3FlowTest_106638`).
    *   Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
    *   Create main script file (e.g., `word_counter.py`).
    *   Create a `README.md` file.
2.  **Argument Parsing:**
    *   Implement CLI argument handling using `argparse` to accept the input file path.
    *   Add help messages (`-h`/`--help`).
3.  **File Handling Logic:**
    *   Implement function(s) to open and read the specified file.
    *   Include `try...except` blocks for error handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, potentially `IOError`).
4.  **Word Counting Logic:**
    *   Implement the core counting function. Read file content, split into words based on whitespace, and return the count.
5.  **Output Formatting:**
    *   Integrate the components so the final count is printed to the console upon successful execution.
    *   Ensure error messages are printed to standard error if issues occur.
6.  **Basic Testing (Recommended):**
    *   Create sample input files (empty, single word, multiple lines, etc.).
    *   Write simple test cases (e.g., using `unittest` or manual execution checks) to verify functionality and error handling.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` with clear instructions on how to install dependencies (if any beyond standard lib), run the tool, and provide examples.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Execute **Project Setup** steps (create directory, init Git, set up venv).
2.  Create the initial `word_counter.py` file.
3.  Begin implementing **Argument Parsing** using the `argparse` module within `word_counter.py`.

This blueprint provides a solid foundation for V1. We'll focus on getting the core functionality working reliably first. Let me know when you're ready to proceed or if adjustments are needed!
