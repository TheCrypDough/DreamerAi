Okay, DreamerAI team! Here is the project blueprint for 'Week3FlowTest_8967', crafted by Arch.

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_8967

## Project Summary
Develop Version 1 (V1) of 'Week3FlowTest_8967', a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Python. The primary function of this tool is to read a specified text file and output the total word count found within that file.

## Core Features (V1)
*   **File Input:** Accept a file path as a mandatory command-line argument.
*   **File Reading:** Securely open and read the contents of the specified text file.
*   **Word Counting:** Process the text content to count the number of words. For V1, words will be delimited by whitespace.
*   **Output Display:** Clearly print the final word count to the standard output (console).
*   **Basic Error Handling:** Implement checks and user-friendly messages for common errors, such as the file not being found or permission issues preventing file reading.

## Potential Tech Stack
*   **Core Language:** Python (Version 3.7 or higher recommended)
*   **CLI Argument Parsing:** `argparse` (Built-in Python standard library)
*   **File Handling:** Standard Python file I/O functions (`open()`, `read()`, context managers `with`)
*   **Development Environment:** Standard Python environment, ideally using a virtual environment (`venv`).
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (Recommended)

*(Note: As this is a simple CLI tool, traditional Frontend/Backend/Database components are not required for V1.)*

## High-Level Steps
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create the main project directory (`Week3FlowTest_8967`).
    *   Initialize a Python virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`).
    *   Activate the virtual environment.
    *   Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    *   Create a basic `.gitignore` file (e.g., for `__pycache__`, `.venv`).
    *   Create the main Python script file (e.g., `word_counter.py` or `main.py`).
2.  **CLI Interface Implementation:**
    *   Import the `argparse` library.
    *   Define an argument parser to accept one positional argument: the input file path.
    *   Parse the command-line arguments in the main execution block.
3.  **Core Logic Development:**
    *   Implement a function that takes a file path as input.
    *   Inside the function:
        *   Use a `try-except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`/`PermissionError`.
        *   Open the file using a `with` statement for safe handling.
        *   Read the file content.
        *   Split the content into words (e.g., using `text.split()`).
        *   Return the count of words (length of the resulting list).
4.  **Integration & Output:**
    *   Call the core logic function with the file path obtained from `argparse`.
    *   Print the returned word count in a user-friendly format (e.g., `File '[filename]' contains [count] words.`).
    *   If an error
