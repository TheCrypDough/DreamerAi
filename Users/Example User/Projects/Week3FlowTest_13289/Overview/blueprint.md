Okay, DreamerAI team, let's get this planned out. Here is the blueprint for `Week3FlowTest_13289`.

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_13289

**Project Summary:**
This project aims to develop Version 1 (V1) of 'Week3FlowTest_13289', a straightforward command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Python. The core function of this tool is to accept a file path as input, read the contents of that file, and output the total number of words found within it.

**Core Features (V1):**

1.  **File Path Input:** Accept a single command-line argument representing the path to the input text file.
2.  **File Reading:** Open and read the content of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting Logic:** Implement logic to split the file content into words (using whitespace as a delimiter initially) and count them.
4.  **Result Output:** Display the final calculated word count clearly on the standard output (console).
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle common errors gracefully, specifically:
    *   File not found.
    *   Permissions error when trying to read the file.

**Potential Tech Stack:**

*   **Core Language:** Python (v3.x recommended)
*   **CLI Argument Parsing:**
    *   `argparse` (Python Standard Library - recommended for simplicity)
    *   *Alternatives:* `click`, `typer` (Consider if more complex CLI features are envisioned later)
*   **File Handling:** Python Standard Library (`open()`, `try...except` blocks for error handling)
*   **Testing Framework (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   `unittest` (Python Standard Library)
    *   `pytest` (Popular third-party option)
*   **Frontend:** N/A (CLI Tool)
*   **Backend:** N/A (Core logic is self-contained within the Python script
