Okay, DreamerAI team, let's map out the plan for 'Week3FlowTest_106846'. Here is the initial blueprint:

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_106846

## Project Summary

The goal is to create **Week3FlowTest_106846**, a Version 1 (V1) command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Python. Its primary function will be to accept a file path as input and output the total word count found within that file.

## Core Features (V1)

1.  **File Input:** Accept a single file path as a command-line argument.
2.  **File Reading:** Open and read the contents of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting:** Process the file content to count the number of words. (Initial definition: split by whitespace).
4.  **Output:** Display the final word count clearly to the standard output.
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle cases where the file does not exist or cannot be read, providing informative error messages.

## Potential Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   Standard Library: `os`, `sys` (for file path handling, basic I/O)
    *   `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments effectively.
*   **Frontend:** N/A (Command-Line Interface)
*   **Backend:** N/A (Self-contained script)
*   **Database:** N/A

## High-Level Steps

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create the main project directory (`Week3FlowTest_106846`).
    *   Initialize a Git repository.
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment (e.g., using `venv`).
    *   Create a `requirements.txt` file (even if initially empty or just for development tools).
    *   Create the main Python script file (e.g., `word_counter.py`).
2.  **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Implement a function to read the content of a given file path.
    *   Implement a function that takes text content and returns the word count.
3.  **CLI Argument Parsing:**
    *   Integrate the `argparse` library to handle the file path argument.
    *   Add help messages (`-h`, `--help`).
4.  **Integration & Output:**
    *   Connect the argument parser to the core logic functions.
    *   Format and print the final word count to the console.
5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Add `try...except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, etc.
    *   Print user-friendly error messages to standard error (`sys.stderr`).
6.  **Basic Testing:**
    *   Create sample text files for testing (e.g., empty file, file with one word, file with multiple lines).
    *   Manually run the script against these test files.
    *   (Optional V1.1) Add simple automated tests using `unittest` or `pytest`.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Add comments to the code.
    *   Create a basic `README.md` explaining how to run the tool and its purpose.

## Next Steps

1.  **Create Project Structure:** Set up the directory, Git repository, and virtual environment as outlined in "Project Setup".
2.  **Implement Basic File Reading:** Write the initial code in `word_counter.py` to simply take a hardcoded file path, open it, and print its content (as a first step before adding argument parsing and counting).
3.  **Add Argument Parsing:** Integrate `argparse` to accept the file path dynamically.

This blueprint provides a solid foundation for V1. We can iterate and add features like punctuation handling, case insensitivity, or support for multiple files later. Let's get building!
