Okay, DreamerAI team! Here is the initial project blueprint for 'Week3FlowTest_106953'.

# Blueprint: Week3FlowTest_106953

**Project Summary:**
To develop Version 1 of 'Week3FlowTest_106953', a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Python. The primary function of this tool is to accept a file path as input and output the total word count found within that file.

**Core Features (V1):**
1.  **Command-Line Argument Parsing:** Accept a single mandatory argument: the path to the input text file.
2.  **File Input:** Open and read the contents of the specified text file.
3.  **Word Counting Logic:** Implement logic to split the file content into words and count them. (Initial definition: split by whitespace).
4.  **Output:** Display the final word count clearly to the user's console.
5.  **Basic Error Handling:** Handle common errors gracefully, such as:
    *   File not found at the specified path.
    *   Permissions errors when trying to read the file.
    *   Incorrect number of arguments provided.

**Potential Tech Stack:**
*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **CLI Argument Parsing:**
    *   `argparse` (Python Standard Library - recommended for simplicity)
    *   `click` (Third-party library - alternative for potentially more complex future CLIs)
*   **File Handling:** Python built-in `open()` function and file methods.
*   **Testing:**
    *   `unittest` (Python Standard Library)
    *   `pytest` (Third-party library - popular alternative)
*   **Packaging (Optional for V1):** `setuptools`
*   **Frontend:** Not Applicable (CLI Tool)
*   **Backend:** Not Applicable (Local Script)
*   **Database:** Not Applicable (No data persistence needed)

**High-Level Steps:**
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create the main project directory (`Week3FlowTest_106953`).
    *   Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv venv`).
    *   Activate the virtual environment.
    *   Create initial files (`main.py`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`).
2.  **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Write a function within `main.py` that takes file content (string) as input and returns the word count.
3.  **File Reading:**
    *   Implement logic to open and read the file specified by a path.
4.  **CLI Interface:**
    *   Use `argparse` to define and parse the command-line argument for the file path.
5.  **Integration & Error Handling:**
    *   Connect the CLI argument parser, file reading, and word counting logic.
    *   Implement `try...except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and potentially others.
    *   Add checks for correct argument usage.
6.  **Basic Testing:**
    *   Create sample input text files (e.g., empty file, file with known word count, file with punctuation).
    *   Write simple test cases (using `unittest` or `pytest`) to verify the core counting logic and error handling.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` with basic usage instructions (how to run the script) and a brief description.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Create the project directory structure as outlined in "Project Setup".
2.  Initialize Git and set up the Python virtual environment.
3.  Create the initial `main.py` file and start implementing the basic `argparse` setup to accept a file path argument.
