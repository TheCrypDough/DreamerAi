**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 21:20:00 # Placeholder

## Current Focus
- Completed Day 10 (UI Shell: Tabs, Beginner Mode & Backend Listener).
- Successfully implemented electron-forge build process (Webpack/Babel) as a deviation to handle JSX transpilation.
- Verified UI shell functionality, including MUI components and backend listener.
- Transitioning to Day 11.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Created `app/src/App.jsx` with React/MUI components and HTTP listener.
- Updated `renderer.js` to mount `App.jsx`.
- Deviated from guide sequence: Installed and configured `electron-forge`, `plugin-webpack`, `babel`, and related loaders/dependencies.
- Created `forge.config.js`, `webpack.main.config.js`, `webpack.renderer.config.js`, `webpack.rules.js`.
- Modified `package.json` (main entry point, forge scripts, dependencies).
- Modified `main.js` (Forge WEBPACK_ENTRY constants).
- Modified `forge.config.js` (added `devContentSecurityPolicy`).
- Modified `index.html` (removed hardcoded script tag).

## Next Steps
- Begin Day 11 tasks as per `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.
- Task 1: (Placeholder - Get from Guide).

## Active Considerations
- Need to address `npm audit` vulnerabilities later.
- Backend bridge needs implementation to send messages to the UI listener.
- Placeholder UI content needs replacement with actual panel components.
