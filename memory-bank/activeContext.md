## Current Focus
- Completed Day 9 (DreamerFlow Orchestration Setup).
- Transitioning to Day 10 (UI Shell: Tabs, Beginner Mode & Backend Listener).

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Created `engine/core/workflow.py` and implemented `DreamerFlow` class.
- Created `main.py` as the main entry point.
- Added test logic to `main.py` to instantiate `ChefJeff` and `DreamerFlow`.
- Successfully executed `python main.py`, verifying that `DreamerFlow` correctly initializes and calls `ChefJeff.run()`, receiving an LLM response.

## Next Steps
- Begin Day 10 tasks as per `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.
- Task 1: Refactor `main.py` for continuous input/dynamic agent map.

## Active Considerations
- `DreamerFlow.execute` currently only calls Jeff.
- `main.py` logic is just a one-shot test; needs refactoring for interactive use.
- Known limitations from Day 8 (Jeff RAG/n8n/events) still apply.
