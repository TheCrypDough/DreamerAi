# Active Project Context

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 18:30:00 # Placeholder

## Current Focus
- Transitioning from Day 6 (LLM Module implementation) to Day 7 (Initial Main Chat Agent).
- Completed implementation and testing of the core LLM class (`engine/ai/llm.py`).
- Verified configuration loading, API key access, and successful generation via both OpenRouter and Ollama.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Successfully debugged and resolved issues in `llm.py` related to:
    - Configuration parsing (`toml` vs `tomllib`, nested structure access).
    - Environment variable loading (`load_dotenv`, `override=True`).
    - `asyncio` misuse (`asyncio.run()` within a running loop).
    - Minor logical errors (`NameError` for `log_rules_check`).
- Confirmed OpenRouter API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) is correctly loaded and functional.
- Confirmed local Ollama server (`gemma3:12b` model) is accessible and functional.
- LLM caching is disabled as Redis is not yet running (as per plan).

## Next Steps
- Begin Day 7 tasks as per `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.
- Create `engine/agents/main_chat.py`.
- Implement the `MainChatAgent` class, inheriting from `BaseAgent`.
- Integrate the `LLM` class for response generation within the agent.

## Active Considerations
- Ensure `MainChatAgent` correctly utilizes the `LLM` instance (likely passed during initialization or accessed via a shared context).
- Plan for basic chat history storage and retrieval within the agent.
- Define the structure for the FastAPI endpoint for the `MainChatAgent`.
