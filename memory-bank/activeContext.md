# Active Project Context

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 19:30:00 # Placeholder

## Current Focus
- Completed Day 7 (Agent Framework Overview).
- Transitioning to Day 8 (Implement Main Chat Agent - Jeff).

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Created placeholder files for core agents (`main_chat.py`, `planning.py`, etc.) in `engine/agents/`.
- Created and executed a temporary Week 1 check script (`tests/week1_check.py`) to verify `DreamerDB` connection and `LLM` instantiation/generation.
- Confirmed core components from Week 1 are functional.
- Deleted the temporary check script.
- Corrected previous deviation where Day 7 tasks were misinterpreted; reverted incorrect `main_chat.py` implementation and `server.py` changes.

## Next Steps
- Begin Day 8 tasks as per `DreamerAi_Guide.md`.
- Task 1: [Placeholder for Day 8 Task 1 - likely start implementing `MainChatAgent`].

## Active Considerations
- Need Day 8 guide content to populate `tasks.md` and proceed with implementation.
- Remember to inherit from `BaseAgent` when implementing `MainChatAgent`.
- Integrate `LLM` instance correctly within the agent.
