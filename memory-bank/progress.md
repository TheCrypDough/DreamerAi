# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 19:30:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 7 (Agent Framework Overview) tasks completed.
- Placeholder files created for core agents (Jeff, Arch, Nexus, Lewis, Hermie, Promptimizer).
- Week 1 Check script confirmed DB connection and LLM instantiation/generation functionality.
- Ready to proceed to Day 8 (Implement Main Chat Agent).

## What Works
- Day 1-7 foundations: Project Setup, Env, BaseAgent, Logging, Electron Shell, DB Core, LLM Module, Agent Placeholders.
- Core components (DB, LLM) verified functional.

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 8: Begin implementing `MainChatAgent` (Jeff) in `engine/agents/main_chat.py`.
    - Task 1: [Placeholder for Day 8 Task 1]

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Redis server is not running, so LLM caching is currently disabled (Expected behaviour for now, addressed Day 38).
- Minor linter warning about missing `requests` stubs persists but doesn't block functionality.
