# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 20:10:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 9 (DreamerFlow Orchestration Setup) tasks completed.
- `DreamerFlow` class implemented in `engine/core/workflow.py`.
- `main.py` created and populated with test logic, successfully executing `DreamerFlow` which called `ChefJeff`.
- Ready to proceed to Day 10 (UI Shell Setup).

## What Works
- Day 1-9 foundations: Includes core orchestrator (`DreamerFlow`) and entry point (`main.py`).
- Basic workflow execution confirmed: `main.py` -> `DreamerFlow.execute()` -> `ChefJeff.run()` -> LLM Response.

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 10: Setup base UI shell with Tabs and backend listener.
    - Task 1: Refactor `main.py` for continuous input/dynamic agent map.

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Jeff V1 RAG query fails (`query_rag` missing in BaseAgent).
- n8n handoff fails if n8n server isn't running/configured.
- Event Manager / UI Bridge calls commented out in Jeff V1.
- Redis caching disabled.
