# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 19:50:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 8 (Build Chef Jeff V1) tasks completed.
- Jeff V1 implemented in `engine/agents/main_chat.py`, inheriting BaseAgent.
- `rules_jeff.md` created and populated.
- RAG DB for Jeff seeded (`data/rag_dbs/rag_jeff_db`).
- Test block in `main_chat.py` verified core LLM generation and task identification logic.
- Known issues logged (RAG query failed due to missing BaseAgent V2 method, n8n connection refused, event/bridge calls commented out).
- Ready to proceed to Day 9 (DreamerFlow Orchestration Setup).

## What Works
- Day 1-8 foundations: Setup, Env, BaseAgent, Logging, Electron Shell, DB Core, LLM Module, Agent Placeholders, Jeff V1 basic implementation.
- Core components (DB, LLM) verified functional.
- Jeff V1 conversational loop & LLM interaction functional.
- RAG DB seeded.

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 9: Setup DreamerFlow orchestrator structure.
    - Task 1: Create `engine/core/workflow.py`.

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Redis caching disabled (Expected - Day 38).
- Minor `requests` stubs linter warning (Ignored).
- Jeff V1 cannot query RAG yet (`query_rag` method missing from current `BaseAgent`).
- n8n handoff fails if n8n server isn't running/configured.
- Event Manager / UI Bridge calls commented out in Jeff V1 (Pending Day 62 / Day 13).
