# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 18:30:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 6 (LLM Module) tasks completed and verified.
- Core LLM class `engine/ai/llm.py` successfully implemented.
- Configuration loading from `config.dev.toml` and `.env.development` is working.
- API key loading for OpenRouter (`cloud_tier1`) is functional.
- Connection and generation verified for both Ollama (`ollama`) and OpenRouter (`cloud_tier1`) via test block.
- Redis caching is integrated but disabled (Redis server not running yet).
- Ready to proceed to Day 7 (Main Chat Agent).

## What Works
- Project initialization (Day 1).
- Python and Node.js environment setup (Day 2).
- BaseAgent class structure and DreamerLogger (Day 3).
- Basic Electron application shell (Day 4).
- SQLite database initialization and basic API-frontend communication (Day 5).
- LLM module initialization and basic generation via OpenRouter and Ollama (Day 6).

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 7: Implement the initial `MainChatAgent`.
    - Create the agent file.
    - Define the class structure.
    - Add basic chat history.
    - Integrate the LLM module for response generation.
    - Create a FastAPI endpoint.
    - Test the agent.

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Redis server is not running, so LLM caching is currently disabled (Expected behaviour for now, addressed Day 38).
- Minor linter warning about missing `requests` stubs persists but doesn't block functionality.
