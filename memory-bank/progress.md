# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 21:20:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 10 (UI Shell: Tabs, Beginner Mode & Backend Listener) tasks completed.
- Implemented electron-forge build process (Webpack/Babel) to handle JSX.
- Created `app/src/App.jsx` with MUI Tabs and Switch components.
- Configured HTTP listener on port 3000 in `App.jsx`.
- Updated `renderer.js` and `main.js` for Forge/Webpack integration.
- Corrected `package.json` main entry and resolved CSP/MIME type errors.
- UI shell verified functional via `npm start`.
- Ready to proceed to Day 11.

## What Works
- Day 1-10 foundations: Includes basic Electron UI shell with React/MUI, tabs, state management, and backend listener.
- JSX transpilation via electron-forge/Webpack/Babel.
- Basic workflow execution (`main.py` -> `DreamerFlow` -> `Jeff`).

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 11: Planning Agent V1 implementation (Placeholder - Get from Guide).

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Jeff V1 RAG query fails (`query_rag` missing in BaseAgent).
- n8n handoff fails if n8n server isn't running/configured.
- Event Manager / UI Bridge calls commented out in Jeff V1.
- Redis caching disabled.
- Electron CSP warning during development (expected).
- 2 high severity vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` (needs investigation).
