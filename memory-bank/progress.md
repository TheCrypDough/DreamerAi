# Project Progress

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-27 21:20:00 # Placeholder

## Current Status
- Day 10 (UI Shell: Tabs, Beginner Mode & Backend Listener) tasks completed.
- Implemented electron-forge build process (Webpack/Babel) to handle JSX.
- Created `app/src/App.jsx` with MUI Tabs and Switch components.
- Configured HTTP listener on port 3000 in `App.jsx`.
- Updated `renderer.js` and `main.js` for Forge/Webpack integration.
- Corrected `package.json` main entry and resolved CSP/MIME type errors.
- UI shell verified functional via `npm start`.
- Ready to proceed to Day 11.

## What Works
- Day 1-10 foundations: Includes basic Electron UI shell with React/MUI, tabs, state management, and backend listener.
- JSX transpilation via electron-forge/Webpack/Babel.
- Basic workflow execution (`main.py` -> `DreamerFlow` -> `Jeff`).

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Day 11: Planning Agent V1 implementation (Placeholder - Get from Guide).

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Jeff V1 RAG query fails (`query_rag` missing in BaseAgent).
- n8n handoff fails if n8n server isn't running/configured.
- Event Manager / UI Bridge calls commented out in Jeff V1.
- Redis caching disabled.
- Electron CSP warning during development (expected).
- 2 high severity vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` (needs investigation).

# Progress

## What Works

*   **Project Setup:** Core directory structure, Git repo, basic configurations (`.env.development`, `config.dev.toml`), `DreamerAi_Guide.md` framework.
*   **Environment:** Python venv activated, initial dependencies installed.
*   **Frontend:** Basic Electron/React app shell (`Dreamer Desktop`) loads with Material-UI styling. Includes panels for Chat (Jeff), Dreamcoder, and now Dream Theatre.
*   **Backend:** Basic FastAPI server (`server.py`) with a `/ping` endpoint and a basic `/chat` endpoint for the Jeff agent (though full agent logic is minimal).
*   **Agent Foundation:** Basic agent structure (`engine/agents/base.py`, `main_chat.py`).
*   **WebSocket Foundation (Backend):** `DreamTheatreService` created, managing connections via `ConnectionManager`. WebSocket endpoint `/ws/dream-theatre/{client_id}` added to `server.py`.
*   **WebSocket Foundation (Frontend):** `DreamTheatrePanel.js` React component created, includes logic to attempt WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:8091/`. Placeholder UI displays connection status and messages.
*   **Offline Frontend Test (Day 21 Task 3):** Confirmed the frontend UI loads correctly, the Chat panel shows a 'Failed to fetch' error, and the Dream Theatre panel shows the expected WebSocket connection refused error when the backend is offline.

## What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   Implement full logic for all 28 agents.
*   Develop the core workflow engine (`workflow.py`).
*   Implement the bridge (`bridge.py`) for backend-to-frontend communication (including Dream Theatre).
*   Build out all UI panel functionalities (Dreamcoder features, etc.).
*   Implement database interactions (SQLite/PostgreSQL).
*   Refine configuration management.
*   Set up CI/CD pipelines.
*   Develop RAG databases and embedding logic.
*   Implement SnapApp templates and Lewis agent.
*   Build Spark teaching features.
*   Address packaging and distribution (`build.bat`, `dist/`).
*   Implement user management and project isolation (`Users/`, `projects/`).
*   Develop plugin architecture.
*   Extensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Successfully integrated the basic Dream Theatre WebSocket endpoint into the backend and connected the frontend panel. Verified frontend behavior with the backend offline.
*   **Next:** Starting Day 21 Task 4: Launch the backend server.

## Known Issues

*   No critical issues currently blocking progress.
*   Expected `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors during the offline test were observed and are resolved by starting the backend.
*   Minor CSP warnings in the browser console during frontend tests (potential future refinement).
